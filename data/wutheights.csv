768,CHAPTER I
768,
768,
768,1801—I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary
768,neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful
768,"country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a"
768,situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect
768,misanthropist’s Heaven—and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable
768,pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little
768,imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes
768,"withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his"
768,"fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further"
768,"in his waistcoat, as I announced my name."
768,
768,“Mr. Heathcliff?” I said.
768,
768,A nod was the answer.
768,
768,"“Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling"
768,"as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have"
768,not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation
768,of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—”
768,
768,"“Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,” he interrupted, wincing. “I should"
768,"not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!”"
768,
768,"The “walk in” was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the"
768,"sentiment, “Go to the Deuce!” even the gate over which he leant"
768,manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that
768,circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested
768,in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.
768,
768,"When he saw my horse’s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put"
768,"out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the"
768,"causeway, calling, as we entered the court,—“Joseph, take Mr."
768,Lockwood’s horse; and bring up some wine.”
768,
768,"“Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,” was the"
768,reflection suggested by this compound order. “No wonder the grass grows
768,"up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.”"
768,
768,"Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale"
768,and sinewy. “The Lord help us!” he soliloquised in an undertone of
768,"peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,"
768,in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of
768,"divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no"
768,reference to my unexpected advent.
768,
768,Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. “Wuthering”
768,"being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the"
768,atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.
768,"Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:"
768,"one may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by"
768,the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and
768,"by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if"
768,"craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build"
768,"it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the"
768,corners defended with large jutting stones.
768,
768,"Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of"
768,"grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the"
768,"principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins"
768,"and shameless little boys, I detected the date “1500,” and the name"
768,"“Hareton Earnshaw.” I would have made a few comments, and requested a"
768,short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at
768,"the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,"
768,and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting
768,the penetralium.
768,
768,"One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any"
768,introductory lobby or passage: they call it here “the house”
768,"pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I"
768,believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat
768,altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of
768,"tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I"
768,"observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge"
768,fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on
768,"the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat"
768,"from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and"
768,"tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very"
768,roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay
768,"bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with"
768,"oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it."
768,"Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of"
768,"horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters"
768,"disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the"
768,"chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two"
768,heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser
768,"reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of"
768,squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.
768,
768,The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as
768,"belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,"
768,and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.
768,"Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on"
768,"the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six"
768,"miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But"
768,Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of
768,"living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a"
768,"gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:"
768,"rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,"
768,because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.
768,"Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred"
768,pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of
768,"the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to"
768,showy displays of feeling—to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He’ll
768,"love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of"
768,"impertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I’m running on too fast: I"
768,bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have
768,entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he
768,"meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope"
768,my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should
768,never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself
768,perfectly unworthy of one.
768,
768,"While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown"
768,into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my
768,"eyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I “never told my love”"
768,"vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have"
768,"guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked"
768,a return—the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I
768,"confess it with shame—shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every"
768,glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was
768,"led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her"
768,"supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp."
768,
768,By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of
768,"deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate."
768,
768,I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which
768,"my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by"
768,"attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and"
768,"was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and"
768,"her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long,"
768,guttural gnarl.
768,
768,"“You’d better let the dog alone,” growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,"
768,checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. “She’s not
768,"accustomed to be spoiled—not kept for a pet.” Then, striding to a side"
768,"door, he shouted again, “Joseph!”"
768,
768,"Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no"
768,"intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me"
768,"_vis-à-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,"
768,who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not
768,"anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,"
768,"imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately"
768,"indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my"
768,"physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and"
768,"leapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the"
768,table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen
768,"four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens"
768,to the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects
768,of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I
768,"could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance"
768,from some of the household in re-establishing peace.
768,
768,Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious
768,"phlegm: I don’t think they moved one second faster than usual, though"
768,"the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an"
768,"inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with"
768,"tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the"
768,"midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her"
768,"tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she"
768,"only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master"
768,entered on the scene.
768,
768,"“What the devil is the matter?” he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I"
768,could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.
768,
768,"“What the devil, indeed!” I muttered. “The herd of possessed swine"
768,"could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,"
768,sir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!”
768,
768,"“They won’t meddle with persons who touch nothing,” he remarked,"
768,"putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. “The"
768,dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?”
768,
768,"“No, thank you.”"
768,
768,"“Not bitten, are you?”"
768,
768,"“If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.” Heathcliff’s"
768,countenance relaxed into a grin.
768,
768,"“Come, come,” he said, “you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a"
768,little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my
768,"dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your"
768,"health, sir?”"
768,
768,I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be
768,"foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,"
768,I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since
768,his humour took that turn. He—probably swayed by prudential
768,consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant—relaxed a little
768,"in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,"
768,"and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,—a"
768,discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of
768,retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and
768,"before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another"
768,visit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I
768,"shall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself"
768,compared with him.

768,
768,CHAPTER II
768,
768,
768,Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend
768,"it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to"
768,"Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.—I dine"
768,"between twelve and one o’clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken"
768,"as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend"
768,my request that I might be served at five)—on mounting the stairs with
768,"this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl"
768,"on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an"
768,infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.
768,"This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a"
768,"four-miles’ walk, arrived at Heathcliff’s garden-gate just in time to"
768,escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.
768,
768,"On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the"
768,air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the
768,"chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered"
768,"with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till"
768,my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.
768,
768,"“Wretched inmates!” I ejaculated, mentally, “you deserve perpetual"
768,"isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least,"
768,I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don’t care—I will
768,"get in!” So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently."
768,Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the
768,barn.
768,
768,“What are ye for?” he shouted. “T’ maister’s down i’ t’ fowld. Go round
768,"by th’ end o’ t’ laith, if ye went to spake to him.”"
768,
768,"“Is there nobody inside to open the door?” I hallooed, responsively."
768,
768,“There’s nobbut t’ missis; and shoo’ll not oppen ’t an ye mak’ yer
768,flaysome dins till neeght.”
768,
768,"“Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?”"
768,
768,"“Nor-ne me! I’ll hae no hend wi’t,” muttered the head, vanishing."
768,
768,The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another
768,"trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,"
768,"appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after"
768,"marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,"
768,"pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful"
768,apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the
768,"radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and"
768,"near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to"
768,"observe the “missis,” an individual whose existence I had never"
768,"previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me"
768,"take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained"
768,motionless and mute.
768,
768,"“Rough weather!” I remarked. “I’m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door"
768,must bear the consequence of your servants’ leisure attendance: I had
768,hard work to make them hear me.”
768,
768,"She never opened her mouth. I stared—she stared also: at any rate, she"
768,"kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly"
768,embarrassing and disagreeable.
768,
768,"“Sit down,” said the young man, gruffly. “He’ll be in soon.”"
768,
768,"I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this"
768,"second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of"
768,owning my acquaintance.
768,
768,“A beautiful animal!” I commenced again. “Do you intend parting with
768,"the little ones, madam?”"
768,
768,"“They are not mine,” said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than"
768,Heathcliff himself could have replied.
768,
768,"“Ah, your favourites are among these?” I continued, turning to an"
768,obscure cushion full of something like cats.
768,
768,“A strange choice of favourites!” she observed scornfully.
768,
768,"Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew"
768,"closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the"
768,evening.
768,
768,"“You should not have come out,” she said, rising and reaching from the"
768,chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.
768,
768,"Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct"
768,"view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and"
768,"apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most"
768,exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;
768,"small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging"
768,"loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in"
768,"expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my"
768,"susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between"
768,"scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected"
768,there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to
768,aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted
768,to assist him in counting his gold.
768,
768,"“I don’t want your help,” she snapped; “I can get them for myself.”"
768,
768,“I beg your pardon!” I hastened to reply.
768,
768,"“Were you asked to tea?” she demanded, tying an apron over her neat"
768,"black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the"
768,pot.
768,
768,"“I shall be glad to have a cup,” I answered."
768,
768,“Were you asked?” she repeated.
768,
768,"“No,” I said, half smiling. “You are the proper person to ask me.”"
768,
768,"She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;"
768,"her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a"
768,child’s ready to cry.
768,
768,"Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby"
768,"upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on"
768,"me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some"
768,mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a
768,"servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of"
768,the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown
768,"curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly"
768,"over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common"
768,"labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed"
768,none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.
768,"In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to"
768,"abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes"
768,"afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,"
768,from my uncomfortable state.
768,
768,"“You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!” I exclaimed, assuming"
768,"the cheerful; “and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if"
768,you can afford me shelter during that space.”
768,
768,"“Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; “I"
768,wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.
768,Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People
768,familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I
768,can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.”
768,
768,"“Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the"
768,Grange till morning—could you spare me one?”
768,
768,"“No, I could not.”"
768,
768,"“Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.”"
768,
768,“Umph!”
768,
768,"“Are you going to mak’ the tea?” demanded he of the shabby coat,"
768,shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.
768,
768,"“Is _he_ to have any?” she asked, appealing to Heathcliff."
768,
768,"“Get it ready, will you?” was the answer, uttered so savagely that I"
768,started. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad
768,nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.
768,"When the preparations were finished, he invited me with—“Now, sir,"
768,"bring forward your chair.” And we all, including the rustic youth, drew"
768,round the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our
768,meal.
768,
768,"I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort"
768,to dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it
768,"was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal"
768,scowl they wore was their every-day countenance.
768,
768,"“It is strange,” I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea"
768,and receiving another—“it is strange how custom can mould our tastes
768,and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life
768,"of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff;"
768,"yet, I’ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with"
768,your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart—”
768,
768,"“My amiable lady!” he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on"
768,his face. “Where is she—my amiable lady?”
768,
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.”"
768,
768,"“Well, yes—oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of"
768,"ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even"
768,when her body is gone. Is that it?”
768,
768,"Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have"
768,seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to
768,make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a
768,period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of
768,being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace
768,of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.
768,
768,"Then it flashed upon me—“The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea"
768,"out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her"
768,"husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being"
768,buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer
768,ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how
768,I cause her to regret her choice.” The last reflection may seem
768,conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on
768,"repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive."
768,
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,” said Heathcliff, corroborating"
768,"my surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a"
768,look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles
768,"that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of"
768,his soul.
768,
768,"“Ah, certainly—I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the"
768,"beneficent fairy,” I remarked, turning to my neighbour."
768,
768,"This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his"
768,"fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to"
768,"recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,"
768,"muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice."
768,
768,"“Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,” observed my host; “we neither of us"
768,have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said
768,"she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.”"
768,
768,“And this young man is—”
768,
768,"“Not my son, assuredly.”"
768,
768,"Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to"
768,attribute the paternity of that bear to him.
768,
768,"“My name is Hareton Earnshaw,” growled the other; “and I’d counsel you"
768,to respect it!”
768,
768,"“I’ve shown no disrespect,” was my reply, laughing internally at the"
768,dignity with which he announced himself.
768,
768,"He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for"
768,fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity
768,audible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant
768,"family circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than"
768,"neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to"
768,be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.
768,
768,"The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of"
768,"sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A"
768,"sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and"
768,hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.
768,
768,"“I don’t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,” I"
768,"could not help exclaiming. “The roads will be buried already; and, if"
768,"they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.”"
768,
768,"“Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They’ll be"
768,"covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,”"
768,said Heathcliff.
768,
768,"“How must I do?” I continued, with rising irritation."
768,
768,There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only
768,"Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff"
768,"leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of"
768,matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the
768,"tea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his"
768,"burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated"
768,"out—“Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i’ idleness un war,"
768,"when all on ’ems goan out! Bud yah’re a nowt, and it’s no use"
768,"talking—yah’ll niver mend o’yer ill ways, but goa raight to t’ divil,"
768,like yer mother afore ye!”
768,
768,"I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to"
768,"me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an"
768,"intention of kicking him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however,"
768,checked me by her answer.
768,
768,“You scandalous old hypocrite!” she replied. “Are you not afraid of
768,"being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil’s name? I"
768,"warn you to refrain from provoking me, or I’ll ask your abduction as a"
768,"special favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,” she continued, taking a long,"
768,dark book from a shelf; “I’ll show you how far I’ve progressed in the
768,Black Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The
768,red cow didn’t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be
768,reckoned among providential visitations!”
768,
768,"“Oh, wicked, wicked!” gasped the elder; “may the Lord deliver us from"
768,evil!”
768,
768,"“No, reprobate! you are a castaway—be off, or I’ll hurt you seriously!"
768,I’ll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes
768,"the limits I fix shall—I’ll not say what he shall be done to—but,"
768,"you’ll see! Go, I’m looking at you!”"
768,
768,"The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and"
768,"Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and"
768,ejaculating “wicked” as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted
768,"by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured"
768,to interest her in my distress.
768,
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said earnestly, “you must excuse me for troubling"
768,"you. I presume, because, with that face, I’m sure you cannot help being"
768,good-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way
768,home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to
768,get to London!”
768,
768,"“Take the road you came,” she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,"
768,"with a candle, and the long book open before her. “It is brief advice,"
768,but as sound as I can give.”
768,
768,"“Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full"
768,"of snow, your conscience won’t whisper that it is partly your fault?”"
768,
768,“How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn’t let me go to the end of the
768,garden wall.”
768,
768,"“_You_! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my"
768,"convenience, on such a night,” I cried. “I want you to _tell_ me my"
768,"way, not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a"
768,guide.”
768,
768,"“Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you"
768,have?”
768,
768,“Are there no boys at the farm?”
768,
768,“No; those are all.”
768,
768,"“Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.”"
768,
768,“That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.”
768,
768,“I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on
768,"these hills,” cried Heathcliff’s stern voice from the kitchen entrance."
768,"“As to staying here, I don’t keep accommodations for visitors: you must"
768,"share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.”"
768,
768,"“I can sleep on a chair in this room,” I replied."
768,
768,"“No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit"
768,me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!” said
768,the unmannerly wretch.
768,
768,With this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of
768,"disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in"
768,"my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and,"
768,"as I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour"
768,amongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend
768,me.
768,
768,"“I’ll go with him as far as the park,” he said."
768,
768,"“You’ll go with him to hell!” exclaimed his master, or whatever"
768,"relation he bore. “And who is to look after the horses, eh?”"
768,
768,“A man’s life is of more consequence than one evening’s neglect of the
768,"horses: somebody must go,” murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I"
768,expected.
768,
768,"“Not at your command!” retorted Hareton. “If you set store on him,"
768,you’d better be quiet.”
768,
768,“Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will
768,"never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,” she answered,"
768,sharply.
768,
768,"“Hearken, hearken, shoo’s cursing on ’em!” muttered Joseph, towards"
768,whom I had been steering.
768,
768,"He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern,"
768,"which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it"
768,"back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern."
768,
768,"“Maister, maister, he’s staling t’ lanthern!” shouted the ancient,"
768,"pursuing my retreat. “Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him,"
768,holld him!”
768,
768,"On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat,"
768,"bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw"
768,from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and
768,"humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching"
768,"their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me"
768,"alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie"
768,"till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and"
768,"trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out—on their"
768,peril to keep me one minute longer—with several incoherent threats of
768,"retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of"
768,King Lear.
768,
768,The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the
768,"nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don’t know"
768,"what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at"
768,"hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my"
768,"entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued"
768,forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some
768,"of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack"
768,"her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger"
768,scoundrel.
768,
768,"“Well, Mr. Earnshaw,” she cried, “I wonder what you’ll have agait next?"
768,Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house
768,"will never do for me—look at t’ poor lad, he’s fair choking! Wisht,"
768,"wisht; you mun’n’t go on so. Come in, and I’ll cure that: there now,"
768,hold ye still.”
768,
768,With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my
768,"neck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his"
768,accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.
768,
768,"I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled"
768,perforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a
768,"glass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she"
768,"condoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders,"
768,"whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed."
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER III
768,
768,
768,"While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the"
768,"candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about"
768,"the chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there"
768,"willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know, she answered: she had"
768,"only lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on,"
768,she could not begin to be curious.
768,
768,"Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced"
768,"round for the bed. The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a"
768,"clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top"
768,"resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure, I looked"
768,"inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch,"
768,very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of
768,"the family having a room to himself. In fact, it formed a little"
768,"closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a"
768,table.
768,
768,"I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them"
768,"together again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff,"
768,and every one else.
768,
768,"The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up"
768,in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.
768,"This writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of"
768,"characters, large and small—_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied"
768,"to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_."
768,
768,"In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued"
768,"spelling over Catherine Earnshaw—Heathcliff—Linton, till my eyes"
768,closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white
768,"letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres—the air swarmed"
768,"with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I"
768,"discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and"
768,perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.
768,
768,"I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and"
768,"lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee."
768,"It was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a"
768,"fly-leaf bore the inscription—“Catherine Earnshaw, her book,” and a"
768,date some quarter of a century back.
768,
768,"I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all."
768,"Catherine’s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it"
768,"to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose:"
768,scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary—at least the
768,appearance of one—covering every morsel of blank that the printer had
768,left. Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a
768,"regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an"
768,"extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was"
768,greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend
768,"Joseph,—rudely, yet powerfully sketched. An immediate interest kindled"
768,"within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher"
768,her faded hieroglyphics.
768,
768,"“An awful Sunday,” commenced the paragraph beneath. “I wish my father"
768,were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute—his conduct to
768,Heathcliff is atrocious—H. and I are going to rebel—we took our
768,initiatory step this evening.
768,
768,"“All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so"
768,"Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while"
768,Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire—doing
768,"anything but reading their Bibles, I’ll answer for it—Heathcliff,"
768,"myself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our"
768,"prayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn,"
768,"groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so"
768,that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! The
768,service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face
768,"to exclaim, when he saw us descending, ‘What, done already?’ On Sunday"
768,"evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much"
768,noise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.
768,
768,"“‘You forget you have a master here,’ says the tyrant. ‘I’ll demolish"
768,the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and
768,"silence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his hair as you"
768,"go by: I heard him snap his fingers.’ Frances pulled his hair heartily,"
768,"and then went and seated herself on her husband’s knee, and there they"
768,"were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour—foolish"
768,palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves as snug as our
768,means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just fastened our
768,"pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes"
768,"Joseph, on an errand from the stables. He tears down my handiwork,"
768,"boxes my ears, and croaks:"
768,
768,"“‘T’ maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o’ered, und t’ sound"
768,"o’ t’ gospel still i’ yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame on ye!"
768,"sit ye down, ill childer! there’s good books eneugh if ye’ll read ’em:"
768,"sit ye down, and think o’ yer sowls!’"
768,
768,"“Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might"
768,receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the
768,lumber he thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. I took my
768,"dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I"
768,hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same place. Then there
768,was a hubbub!
768,
768,"“‘Maister Hindley!’ shouted our chaplain. ‘Maister, coom hither! Miss"
768,"Cathy’s riven th’ back off “Th’ Helmet o’ Salvation,” un’ Heathcliff’s"
768,pawsed his fit into t’ first part o’ “T’ Brooad Way to Destruction!”
768,It’s fair flaysome that ye let ’em go on this gait. Ech! th’ owd man
768,wad ha’ laced ’em properly—but he’s goan!’
768,
768,"“Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of"
768,"us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the"
768,"back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, ‘owd Nick’ would fetch us as"
768,"sure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate"
768,"nook to await his advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a"
768,"shelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got"
768,the time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is
768,"impatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman’s"
768,"cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant"
768,"suggestion—and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his"
768,"prophecy verified—we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we"
768,are here.”
768,
768,* * * * * *
768,
768,
768,"I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took"
768,up another subject: she waxed lachrymose.
768,
768,“How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!” she
768,"wrote. “My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I"
768,"can’t give over. Poor Heathcliff! Hindley calls him a vagabond, and"
768,"won’t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he"
768,"and I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the"
768,house if we break his orders. He has been blaming our father (how dared
768,he?) for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to
768,his right place—”
768,
768,* * * * * *
768,
768,
768,I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from
768,"manuscript to print. I saw a red ornamented title—“Seventy Times Seven,"
768,and the First of the Seventy-First. A Pious Discourse delivered by the
768,"Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.” And while"
768,"I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez"
768,"Branderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell"
768,"asleep. Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper! What else"
768,could it be that made me pass such a terrible night? I don’t remember
768,another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of
768,suffering.
768,
768,"I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality."
768,"I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph"
768,"for a guide. The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered"
768,"on, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not"
768,brought a pilgrim’s staff: telling me that I could never get into the
768,"house without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel,"
768,which I understood to be so denominated. For a moment I considered it
768,absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own
768,residence. Then a new idea flashed across me. I was not going there: we
768,"were journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the"
768,"text—“Seventy Times Seven;” and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had"
768,"committed the “First of the Seventy-First,” and were to be publicly"
768,exposed and excommunicated.
768,
768,"We came to the chapel. I have passed it really in my walks, twice or"
768,"thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow,"
768,"near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes"
768,of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept
768,whole hitherto; but as the clergyman’s stipend is only twenty pounds
768,"per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to"
768,"determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor:"
768,especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let
768,him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own
768,"pockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive"
768,congregation; and he preached—good God! what a sermon; divided into
768,"_four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary"
768,"address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he"
768,"searched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of"
768,"interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin"
768,different sins on every occasion. They were of the most curious
768,character: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.
768,
768,"Oh, how weary I grew. How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and"
768,"revived! How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and"
768,"stood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he"
768,"would _ever_ have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he"
768,"reached the “_First of the Seventy-First_.” At that crisis, a sudden"
768,inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez
768,Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.
768,
768,"“Sir,” I exclaimed, “sitting here within these four walls, at one"
768,"stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads"
768,of your discourse. Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat
768,and been about to depart—Seventy times seven times have you
768,preposterously forced me to resume my seat. The four hundred and
768,"ninety-first is too much. Fellow-martyrs, have at him! Drag him down,"
768,"and crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no"
768,more!”
768,
768,"“_Thou art the Man!_” cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over"
768,his cushion. “Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy
768,"visage—seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul—Lo, this is"
768,human weakness: this also may be absolved! The First of the
768,"Seventy-First is come. Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written."
768,Such honour have all His saints!”
768,
768,"With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim’s"
768,"staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in"
768,"self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most"
768,"ferocious assailant, for his. In the confluence of the multitude,"
768,"several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces."
768,Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter
768,"rappings: every man’s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,"
768,"unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud"
768,"taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at"
768,"last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had"
768,suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez’s part in the
768,row? Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the
768,"blast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes! I"
768,"listened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and"
768,"dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than"
768,before.
768,
768,"This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard"
768,"distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,"
768,"the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right"
768,"cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if"
768,"possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the"
768,casement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance
768,"observed by me when awake, but forgotten. “I must stop it,"
768,"nevertheless!” I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and"
768,stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of
768,"which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!"
768,
768,The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my
768,"arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,"
768,
768,“Let me in—let me in!”
768,
768,"“Who are you?” I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself."
768,
768,"“Catherine Linton,” it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of"
768,_Linton_? I had read _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)—“I’m come
768,home: I’d lost my way on the moor!”
768,
768,"As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child’s face looking through the"
768,"window. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt"
768,"shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and"
768,rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes:
768,"still it wailed, “Let me in!” and maintained its tenacious gripe,"
768,almost maddening me with fear.
768,
768,"“How can I!” I said at length. “Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you"
768,in!”
768,
768,"The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled"
768,"the books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude"
768,the lamentable prayer.
768,
768,"I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the"
768,"instant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!"
768,
768,"“Begone!” I shouted. “I’ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty"
768,years.”
768,
768,"“It is twenty years,” mourned the voice: “twenty years. I’ve been a"
768,waif for twenty years!”
768,
768,"Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved"
768,as if thrust forward.
768,
768,"I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in"
768,a frenzy of fright.
768,
768,"To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps"
768,"approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous"
768,"hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed."
768,"I sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead:"
768,"the intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself."
768,
768,"At last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer,"
768,
768,“Is any one here?”
768,
768,I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff’s
768,"accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet."
768,
768,"With this intention, I turned and opened the panels. I shall not soon"
768,forget the effect my action produced.
768,
768,"Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a"
768,"candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall"
768,behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric
768,"shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and"
768,"his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up."
768,
768,"“It is only your guest, sir,” I called out, desirous to spare him the"
768,humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. “I had the misfortune to
768,"scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare. I’m sorry I"
768,disturbed you.”
768,
768,"“Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the—” commenced"
768,"my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible"
768,to hold it steady. “And who showed you up into this room?” he
768,"continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to"
768,subdue the maxillary convulsions. “Who was it? I’ve a good mind to turn
768,them out of the house this moment!”
768,
768,"“It was your servant Zillah,” I replied, flinging myself on to the"
768,"floor, and rapidly resuming my garments. “I should not care if you did,"
768,Mr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it. I suppose that she wanted to
768,"get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it"
768,"is—swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up,"
768,I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!”
768,
768,"“What do you mean?” asked Heathcliff, “and what are you doing? Lie down"
768,"and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven’s sake!"
768,"don’t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you"
768,were having your throat cut!”
768,
768,"“If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have"
768,strangled me!” I returned. “I’m not going to endure the persecutions of
768,your hospitable ancestors again. Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham
768,"akin to you on the mother’s side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or"
768,"Earnshaw, or however she was called—she must have been a"
768,changeling—wicked little soul! She told me she had been walking the
768,earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal
768,"transgressions, I’ve no doubt!”"
768,
768,Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of
768,"Heathcliff’s with Catherine’s name in the book, which had completely"
768,"slipped from my memory, till thus awakened. I blushed at my"
768,"inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the"
768,"offence, I hastened to add—“The truth is, sir, I passed the first part"
768,of the night in—” Here I stopped afresh—I was about to say “perusing
768,"those old volumes,” then it would have revealed my knowledge of their"
768,"written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I"
768,went on—“in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A
768,"monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or—”"
768,
768,“What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_” thundered
768,"Heathcliff with savage vehemence. “How—how _dare_ you, under my"
768,roof?—God! he’s mad to speak so!” And he struck his forehead with rage.
768,
768,I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my
768,explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and
768,proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation
768,"of “Catherine Linton” before, but reading it often over produced an"
768,impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination
768,under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the
768,"bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I"
768,"guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he"
768,struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show
768,"him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather"
768,"noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the"
768,night: “Not three o’clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six.
768,Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!”
768,
768,"“Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,” said my host, suppressing"
768,"a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm’s shadow, dashing"
768,"a tear from his eyes. “Mr. Lockwood,” he added, “you may go into my"
768,"room: you’ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your"
768,childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.”
768,
768,"“And for me, too,” I replied. “I’ll walk in the yard till daylight, and"
768,then I’ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.
768,"I’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or"
768,town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.”
768,
768,"“Delightful company!” muttered Heathcliff. “Take the candle, and go"
768,"where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard,"
768,"though, the dogs are unchained; and the house—Juno mounts sentinel"
768,"there, and—nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But,"
768,away with you! I’ll come in two minutes!”
768,
768,"I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the"
768,"narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a"
768,"piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly,"
768,"his apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the"
768,"lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion"
768,"of tears. “Come in! come in!” he sobbed. “Cathy, do come. Oh, do—_once_"
768,"more! Oh! my heart’s darling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!”"
768,The spectre showed a spectre’s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of
768,"being; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my"
768,"station, and blowing out the light."
768,
768,There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this
768,"raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,"
768,"half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my"
768,"ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was"
768,"beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions,"
768,"and landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly"
768,"together, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except"
768,"a brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a"
768,querulous mew.
768,
768,"Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the"
768,"hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the"
768,"other. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and"
768,"then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the"
768,"roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose. He cast a"
768,sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between
768,"the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in"
768,"the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with"
768,tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of
768,impudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his
768,"lips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury"
768,"unannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a"
768,"profound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came."
768,
768,A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a
768,"“good-morning,” but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for"
768,"Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of"
768,"curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a"
768,corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over
768,"the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of"
768,"exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed,"
768,"by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard"
768,"couch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an"
768,"inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate"
768,"sound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my"
768,locality.
768,
768,"It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah"
768,urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.
768,"Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the"
768,blaze. She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her
768,"eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to"
768,"chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,"
768,"now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face. I was"
768,"surprised to see Heathcliff there also. He stood by the fire, his back"
768,"towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever"
768,"and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron,"
768,and heave an indignant groan.
768,
768,"“And you, you worthless—” he broke out as I entered, turning to his"
768,"daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or"
768,"sheep, but generally represented by a dash—. “There you are, at your"
768,idle tricks again! The rest of them do earn their bread—you live on my
768,"charity! Put your trash away, and find something to do. You shall pay"
768,"me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight—do you hear,"
768,damnable jade?”
768,
768,"“I’ll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,” answered"
768,"the young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair. “But I’ll"
768,"not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I"
768,please!”
768,
768,"Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,"
768,obviously acquainted with its weight. Having no desire to be
768,"entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if"
768,"eager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any"
768,knowledge of the interrupted dispute. Each had enough decorum to
768,"suspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of"
768,"temptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked"
768,"to a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a"
768,statue during the remainder of my stay. That was not long. I declined
768,"joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an"
768,"opportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and"
768,cold as impalpable ice.
768,
768,My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the
768,"garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor. It was well he"
768,"did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells"
768,and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the
768,"ground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges"
768,"of mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my"
768,yesterday’s walk left pictured in my mind. I had remarked on one side
768,"of the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright"
768,"stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were"
768,"erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark,"
768,"and also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on"
768,"either hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing"
768,"up here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my"
768,companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the
768,"right or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings"
768,of the road.
768,
768,"We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of"
768,"Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there. Our adieux were"
768,"limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own"
768,resources; for the porter’s lodge is untenanted as yet. The distance
768,from the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make
768,"it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the"
768,neck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it
768,"can appreciate. At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock"
768,chimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for
768,every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.
768,
768,"My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,"
768,"tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured"
768,that I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set
768,"about the search for my remains. I bid them be quiet, now that they saw"
768,"me returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs;"
768,"whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or"
768,"forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study,"
768,feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and
768,smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER IV
768,
768,
768,"What vain weather-cocks we are! I, who had determined to hold myself"
768,"independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at"
768,"length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable—I,"
768,"weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits"
768,"and solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under"
768,pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my
768,"establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit"
768,"down while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip,"
768,and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.
768,
768,"“You have lived here a considerable time,” I commenced; “did you not"
768,say sixteen years?”
768,
768,"“Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;"
768,"after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.”"
768,
768,“Indeed.”
768,
768,"There ensued a pause. She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her"
768,"own affairs, and those could hardly interest me. However, having"
768,"studied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of"
768,"meditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated—“Ah, times are"
768,greatly changed since then!”
768,
768,"“Yes,” I remarked, “you’ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?”"
768,
768,"“I have: and troubles too,” she said."
768,
768,"“Oh, I’ll turn the talk on my landlord’s family!” I thought to myself."
768,"“A good subject to start! And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to"
768,"know her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is"
768,"more probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise"
768,for kin.” With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let
768,"Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence"
768,so much inferior. “Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good
768,order?” I inquired.
768,
768,"“Rich, sir!” she returned. “He has nobody knows what money, and every"
768,"year it increases. Yes, yes, he’s rich enough to live in a finer house"
768,"than this: but he’s very near—close-handed; and, if he had meant to"
768,"flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he"
768,could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.
768,"It is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the"
768,world!”
768,
768,"“He had a son, it seems?”"
768,
768,"“Yes, he had one—he is dead.”"
768,
768,"“And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?”"
768,
768,“Yes.”
768,
768,“Where did she come from originally?”
768,
768,"“Why, sir, she is my late master’s daughter: Catherine Linton was her"
768,"maiden name. I nursed her, poor thing! I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would"
768,"remove here, and then we might have been together again.”"
768,
768,"“What! Catherine Linton?” I exclaimed, astonished. But a minute’s"
768,"reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine. “Then,” I"
768,"continued, “my predecessor’s name was Linton?”"
768,
768,“It was.”
768,
768,"“And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr."
768,Heathcliff? Are they relations?”
768,
768,“No; he is the late Mrs. Linton’s nephew.”
768,
768,"“The young lady’s cousin, then?”"
768,
768,"“Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother’s, the"
768,other on the father’s side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton’s sister.”
768,
768,“I see the house at Wuthering Heights has ‘Earnshaw’ carved over the
768,front door. Are they an old family?”
768,
768,"“Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is"
768,"of us—I mean, of the Lintons. Have you been to Wuthering Heights? I beg"
768,pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!”
768,
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I"
768,"think, not very happy.”"
768,
768,"“Oh dear, I don’t wonder! And how did you like the master?”"
768,
768,"“A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean. Is not that his character?”"
768,
768,"“Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone! The less you meddle with"
768,him the better.”
768,
768,“He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.
768,Do you know anything of his history?”
768,
768,"“It’s a cuckoo’s, sir—I know all about it: except where he was born,"
768,"and who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And"
768,Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate
768,lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has
768,been cheated.”
768,
768,"“Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of"
768,my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good
768,enough to sit and chat an hour.”
768,
768,"“Oh, certainly, sir! I’ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I’ll sit"
768,"as long as you please. But you’ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and"
768,you must have some gruel to drive it out.”
768,
768,"The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head"
768,"felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to"
768,"a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain. This caused me to"
768,"feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious"
768,effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday. She returned
768,"presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having"
768,"placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to"
768,find me so companionable.
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"Before I came to live here, she commenced—waiting no farther invitation"
768,to her story—I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my
768,"mother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton’s father, and"
768,"I got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped"
768,"to make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody"
768,would set me to. One fine summer morning—it was the beginning of
768,"harvest, I remember—Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs,"
768,"dressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be"
768,"done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me—for I sat"
768,"eating my porridge with them—and he said, speaking to his son, “Now, my"
768,"bonny man, I’m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you? You"
768,"may choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there"
768,"and back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!” Hindley named a"
768,"fiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but"
768,"she could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip. He did"
768,"not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe"
768,"sometimes. He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and"
768,"then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off."
768,
768,It seemed a long while to us all—the three days of his absence—and
768,often did little Cathy ask when he would be home. Mrs. Earnshaw
768,"expected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal"
768,"off hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at"
768,last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look. Then
768,"it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to"
768,"be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o’clock, the door-latch"
768,"was raised quietly, and in stepped the master. He threw himself into a"
768,"chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was"
768,nearly killed—he would not have such another walk for the three
768,kingdoms.
768,
768,"“And at the end of it to be flighted to death!” he said, opening his"
768,"great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms. “See here, wife! I"
768,was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e’en take it
768,as a gift of God; though it’s as dark almost as if it came from the
768,devil.”
768,
768,"We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy’s head I had a peep at a dirty,"
768,"ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed,"
768,its face looked older than Catherine’s; yet when it was set on its
768,"feet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some"
768,"gibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs."
768,"Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how"
768,"he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had"
768,"their own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and"
768,whether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was
768,"really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst"
768,"her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and"
768,"as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and"
768,"inquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said;"
768,"and his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take"
768,"it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he"
768,"was determined he would not leave it as he found it. Well, the"
768,"conclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr."
768,"Earnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep"
768,with the children.
768,
768,Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till
768,"peace was restored: then, both began searching their father’s pockets"
768,for the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of
768,"fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to"
768,"morsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she"
768,"learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger,"
768,showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing;
768,"earning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her"
768,"cleaner manners. They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or"
768,"even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing"
768,"of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow. By chance, or"
768,"else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw’s door,"
768,and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as
768,"to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my"
768,cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.
768,
768,This was Heathcliff’s first introduction to the family. On coming back
768,"a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual),"
768,I found they had christened him “Heathcliff”: it was the name of a son
768,"who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for"
768,Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but
768,Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued
768,and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn’t reasonable enough to feel
768,"my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when"
768,she saw him wronged.
768,
768,"He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:"
768,"he would stand Hindley’s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and"
768,"my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if"
768,"he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This"
768,"endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son"
768,"persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him. He took to"
768,"Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said"
768,"precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above"
768,"Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite."
768,
768,"So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at"
768,"Mrs. Earnshaw’s death, which happened in less than two years after, the"
768,young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather
768,"than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent’s affections"
768,and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these
768,injuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the
768,"measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at"
768,"once, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he"
768,lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose
768,"he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn’t wit to guess that I"
768,"was compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was the quietest"
768,child that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the
768,others forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me
768,"terribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not"
768,"gentleness, made him give little trouble."
768,
768,"He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing"
768,"to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and"
768,"softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus"
768,"Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn’t dote on Heathcliff, and I"
768,wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy;
768,"who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of"
768,"gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply"
768,"insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and"
768,conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to
768,"bend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought"
768,"a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one."
768,"Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he"
768,"discovered it, he said to Hindley—"
768,
768,“You must exchange horses with me: I don’t like mine; and if you won’t
768,I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you’ve given me this
768,"week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.” Hindley put"
768,"out his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. “You’d better do it at"
768,"once,” he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable):"
768,"“you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you’ll get them again"
768,"with interest.” “Off, dog!” cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron"
768,"weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. “Throw it,” he replied,"
768,"standing still, “and then I’ll tell how you boasted that you would turn"
768,"me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn"
768,"you out directly.” Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and"
768,"down he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and,"
768,"had not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and"
768,"got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who"
768,"had caused it. “Take my colt, Gipsy, then!” said young Earnshaw. “And I"
768,"pray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly"
768,interloper! and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards
768,"show him what you are, imp of Satan.—And take that, I hope he’ll kick"
768,out your brains!”
768,
768,"Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall;"
768,"he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking"
768,"him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes"
768,"were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to"
768,"witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his"
768,"intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a"
768,"bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned,"
768,before he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the
768,blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told
768,"since he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such"
768,"stirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was"
768,"deceived completely, as you will hear."
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER V
768,
768,
768,In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active
768,"and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was"
768,confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing
768,vexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into
768,fits. This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose
768,"upon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a"
768,word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head
768,"the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to"
768,do him an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder
768,"among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his"
768,partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child’s
768,"pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,"
768,"or thrice, Hindley’s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near,"
768,"roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and"
768,shook with rage that he could not do it.
768,
768,"At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by"
768,"teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land"
768,himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.
768,"Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said—“Hindley was"
768,"nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.”"
768,
768,I hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the
768,master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the
768,discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as
768,"he would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his"
768,"sinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for"
768,"two people—Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay,"
768,"up yonder. He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest"
768,self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the
768,promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his
768,"knack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a"
768,great impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master
768,"became, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him"
768,"about his soul’s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly. He"
768,"encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after"
768,"night, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against"
768,Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw’s weakness
768,by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.
768,
768,Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up
768,before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener
768,in a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to
768,"bed, we had not a minute’s security that she wouldn’t be in mischief."
768,"Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always"
768,"going—singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the"
768,"same. A wild, wicked slip she was—but she had the bonniest eye, the"
768,"sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I"
768,believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good
768,"earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and"
768,oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too
768,fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was
768,to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us
768,"on his account. In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little"
768,"mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she"
768,"did so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let"
768,her know.
768,
768,"Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had"
768,"always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had"
768,no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing
768,condition than he was in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened in her
768,a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we
768,"were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy"
768,"look, and her ready words; turning Joseph’s religious curses into"
768,"ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most—showing"
768,"how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over"
768,Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in
768,"anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination. After"
768,"behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to"
768,"make it up at night. “Nay, Cathy,” the old man would say, “I cannot"
768,"love thee, thou’rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child,"
768,and ask God’s pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever
768,"reared thee!” That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed"
768,"continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was"
768,"sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven."
768,
768,"But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw’s troubles on"
768,"earth. He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the"
768,"fire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the"
768,"chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were"
768,"all together—I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting,"
768,and Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally
768,"sat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy had been"
768,"sick, and that made her still; she leant against her father’s knee, and"
768,Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember
768,"the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair—it"
768,"pleased him rarely to see her gentle—and saying, “Why canst thou not"
768,"always be a good lass, Cathy?” And she turned her face up to his, and"
768,"laughed, and answered, “Why cannot you always be a good man, father?”"
768,"But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said"
768,"she would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his"
768,"fingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told"
768,"her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him. We all kept as"
768,"mute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only"
768,"Joseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse"
768,"the master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and called him by"
768,"name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the"
768,candle and looked at him. I thought there was something wrong as he set
768,"down the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them"
768,"to “frame upstairs, and make little din—they might pray alone that"
768,evening—he had summut to do.”
768,
768,"“I shall bid father good-night first,” said Catherine, putting her arms"
768,"round his neck, before we could hinder her. The poor thing discovered"
768,"her loss directly—she screamed out—“Oh, he’s dead, Heathcliff! he’s"
768,dead!” And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.
768,
768,"I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we"
768,could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He
768,told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the
768,"parson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then."
768,"However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor,"
768,back with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving
768,"Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children’s room: their door was"
768,"ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but"
768,"they were calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls"
768,were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit
768,on: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they
768,"did, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could"
768,not help wishing we were all there safe together.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER VI
768,
768,
768,"Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and—a thing that amazed us, and"
768,set the neighbours gossiping right and left—he brought a wife with him.
768,"What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably,"
768,"she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely"
768,have kept the union from his father.
768,
768,She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own
768,"account. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,"
768,appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about
768,"her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the"
768,"mourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that"
768,"went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I"
768,should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and
768,"clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly—“Are they gone yet?” Then she"
768,began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her
768,"to see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell"
768,"a-weeping—and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn’t"
768,know; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely
768,"to die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and"
768,"fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did"
768,"remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very"
768,"quick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that"
768,she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these
768,"symptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don’t"
768,"in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to"
768,us first.
768,
768,Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his
768,"absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and"
768,"dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told"
768,Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the
768,"back-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have"
768,carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife
768,"expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace,"
768,"at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space"
768,"there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it"
768,"unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention."
768,
768,"She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new"
768,"acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran"
768,"about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning."
768,"Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,"
768,"Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to"
768,"Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy."
768,"He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the"
768,"instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of"
768,doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the
768,farm.
768,
768,"Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy"
768,"taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the"
768,fields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the
768,"young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they"
768,"did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their"
768,"going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his"
768,carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to
768,"order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or"
768,supper. But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the
768,"moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment"
768,grew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as
768,"he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash"
768,Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they
768,were together again: at least the minute they had contrived some
768,naughty plan of revenge; and many a time I’ve cried to myself to watch
768,"them growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable,"
768,for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended
768,"creatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from"
768,"the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind;"
768,"and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere."
768,"We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they"
768,"were invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the"
768,"doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household"
768,"went to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put"
768,"my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in"
768,"spite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I"
768,"distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern"
768,glimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to
768,prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was
768,"Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone."
768,
768,"“Where is Miss Catherine?” I cried hurriedly. “No accident, I hope?”"
768,"“At Thrushcross Grange,” he answered; “and I would have been there too,"
768,"but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.” “Well, you will catch"
768,it!” I said: “you’ll never be content till you’re sent about your
768,business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?”
768,"“Let me get off my wet clothes, and I’ll tell you all about it, Nelly,”"
768,"he replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he"
768,"undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued—“Cathy and I"
768,"escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a"
768,"glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see"
768,whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in
768,"corners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and"
768,"singing and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do"
768,"you think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their"
768,"man-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they"
768,"don’t answer properly?” “Probably not,” I responded. “They are good"
768,"children, no doubt, and don’t deserve the treatment you receive, for"
768,"your bad conduct.” “Don’t cant, Nelly,” he said: “nonsense! We ran from"
768,"the top of the Heights to the park, without stopping—Catherine"
768,"completely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You’ll have to"
768,seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept through a broken
768,"hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a"
768,flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence;
768,"they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half"
768,"closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement,"
768,"and clinging to the ledge, and we saw—ah! it was beautiful—a splendid"
768,"place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and"
768,"a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging"
768,"in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft"
768,tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister
768,had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn’t they have been happy? We
768,"should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good"
768,"children were doing? Isabella—I believe she is eleven, a year younger"
768,"than Cathy—lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as"
768,if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the
768,"hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little"
768,"dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations,"
768,we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The idiots!
768,That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm
768,"hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it,"
768,refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did
768,despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine
768,"wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and"
768,"sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I’d not"
768,"exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton’s"
768,at Thrushcross Grange—not if I might have the privilege of flinging
768,"Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with"
768,Hindley’s blood!”
768,
768,"“Hush, hush!” I interrupted. “Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,"
768,how Catherine is left behind?”
768,
768,"“I told you we laughed,” he answered. “The Lintons heard us, and with"
768,"one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and"
768,"then a cry, ‘Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh,"
768,"papa, oh!’ They really did howl out something in that way. We made"
768,"frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off"
768,"the ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had"
768,"better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all"
768,"at once she fell down. ‘Run, Heathcliff, run!’ she whispered. ‘They"
768,"have let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!’ The devil had seized her"
768,"ankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out—no!"
768,"she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns"
768,"of a mad cow. I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate"
768,any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his
768,"jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast"
768,"of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting—‘Keep fast,"
768,"Skulker, keep fast!’ He changed his note, however, when he saw"
768,"Skulker’s game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue"
768,"hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming"
768,"with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear,"
768,"I’m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling"
768,"execrations and vengeance. ‘What prey, Robert?’ hallooed Linton from"
768,"the entrance. ‘Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,’ he replied; ‘and"
768,"there’s a lad here,’ he added, making a clutch at me, ‘who looks an"
768,out-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the
768,"window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they"
768,"might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed"
768,"thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir,"
768,"don’t lay by your gun.’ ‘No, no, Robert,’ said the old fool. ‘The"
768,rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me
768,"cleverly. Come in; I’ll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten"
768,"the chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his"
768,"stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop?"
768,"Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don’t be afraid, it is but a boy—yet the"
768,villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to
768,"the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as"
768,"well as features?’ He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton"
768,placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The
768,"cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping—‘Frightful thing!"
768,"Put him in the cellar, papa. He’s exactly like the son of the"
768,"fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn’t he, Edgar?’"
768,
768,"“While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech,"
768,"and laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected"
768,"sufficient wit to recognise her. They see us at church, you know,"
768,though we seldom meet them elsewhere. ‘That’s Miss Earnshaw!’ he
768,"whispered to his mother, ‘and look how Skulker has bitten her—how her"
768,foot bleeds!’
768,
768,“‘Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!’ cried the dame; ‘Miss Earnshaw scouring the
768,"country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning—surely"
768,it is—and she may be lamed for life!’
768,
768,"“‘What culpable carelessness in her brother!’ exclaimed Mr. Linton,"
768,turning from me to Catherine. ‘I’ve understood from Shielders’” (that
768,"was the curate, sir) “‘that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism."
768,But who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare
768,"he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey"
768,"to Liverpool—a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.’"
768,
768,"“‘A wicked boy, at all events,’ remarked the old lady, ‘and quite unfit"
768,"for a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I’m shocked"
768,that my children should have heard it.’
768,
768,"“I recommenced cursing—don’t be angry, Nelly—and so Robert was ordered"
768,to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the
768,"garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw"
768,"should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,"
768,secured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one
768,"corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had"
768,"wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a"
768,"million of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa"
768,quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we
768,"had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with"
768,"her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction"
768,between her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin
768,"of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of"
768,"negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar"
768,"stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her"
768,"beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled"
768,"her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her"
768,"food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he"
768,ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the
768,Lintons—a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were
768,full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them—to
768,"everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?”"
768,
768,"“There will more come of this business than you reckon on,” I answered,"
768,"covering him up and extinguishing the light. “You are incurable,"
768,"Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if"
768,he won’t.” My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure
768,"made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a"
768,"visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture"
768,"on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about"
768,"him, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that"
768,the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal;
768,and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint
768,"when she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would"
768,have found it impossible.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER VII
768,
768,
768,Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that
768,"time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The"
768,"mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of"
768,reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and
768,"flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless"
768,"little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all"
768,"breathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified"
768,"person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered"
768,"beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with"
768,"both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse,"
768,"exclaiming delightedly, “Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should"
768,scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is
768,"not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?” “Isabella has not her"
768,"natural advantages,” replied his wife: “but she must mind and not grow"
768,"wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things—Stay,"
768,"dear, you will disarrange your curls—let me untie your hat.”"
768,
768,"I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk"
768,"frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes"
768,"sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she"
768,dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid
768,garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas
768,"cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked"
768,round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their
768,"meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what"
768,grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.
768,
768,"Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and"
768,"uncared for, before Catherine’s absence, he had been ten times more so"
768,"since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,"
768,"and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom"
768,"have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention"
768,"his clothes, which had seen three months’ service in mire and dust, and"
768,"his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally"
768,"beclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a"
768,"bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed"
768,"counterpart of himself, as he expected. “Is Heathcliff not here?” she"
768,"demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully"
768,whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.
768,
768,"“Heathcliff, you may come forward,” cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his"
768,"discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard"
768,he would be compelled to present himself. “You may come and wish Miss
768,"Catherine welcome, like the other servants.”"
768,
768,"Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to"
768,embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the
768,"second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,"
768,"exclaiming, “Why, how very black and cross you look! and how—how funny"
768,and grim! But that’s because I’m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.
768,"Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?”"
768,
768,"She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw"
768,"double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable."
768,
768,"“Shake hands, Heathcliff,” said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; “once in"
768,"a way, that is permitted.”"
768,
768,"“I shall not,” replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; “I shall"
768,not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!”
768,
768,"And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him"
768,again.
768,
768,"“I did not mean to laugh at you,” she said; “I could not hinder myself:"
768,"Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only"
768,"that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will"
768,be all right: but you are so dirty!”
768,
768,"She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and"
768,also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from
768,its contact with his.
768,
768,"“You needn’t have touched me!” he answered, following her eye and"
768,snatching away his hand. “I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like
768,"to be dirty, and I will be dirty.”"
768,
768,"With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of"
768,"the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine;"
768,who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an
768,exhibition of bad temper.
768,
768,"After playing lady’s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the"
768,"oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,"
768,"befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by"
768,"singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph’s affirmations that he"
768,considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had
768,"retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw"
768,were engaging Missy’s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to
768,"present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness."
768,"They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the"
768,"invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that"
768,her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that “naughty swearing
768,boy.”
768,
768,Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent
768,"of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the"
768,"polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready"
768,"to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless"
768,purity of my particular care—the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave
768,"due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old"
768,"Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,"
768,and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I
768,"went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he"
768,should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally
768,"led me to consider the poor lad’s situation now, and from singing I"
768,"changed my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be"
768,more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding
768,tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was
768,not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the
768,"stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom."
768,
768,"“Make haste, Heathcliff!” I said, “the kitchen is so comfortable; and"
768,"Joseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss"
768,"Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth"
768,"to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.”"
768,
768,"He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me."
768,
768,“Come—are you coming?” I continued. “There’s a little cake for each of
768,"you, nearly enough; and you’ll need half-an-hour’s donning.”"
768,
768,"I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped"
768,with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an
768,"unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on"
768,the other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the
768,"fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o’clock, and then"
768,"marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world"
768,of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into
768,"the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only"
768,"stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the"
768,"morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour"
768,on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for
768,church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better
768,"spirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his"
768,"courage, exclaimed abruptly—“Nelly, make me decent, I’m going to be"
768,good.”
768,
768,"“High time, Heathcliff,” I said; “you _have_ grieved Catherine: she’s"
768,"sorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her,"
768,because she is more thought of than you.”
768,
768,"The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the"
768,notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.
768,
768,"“Did she say she was grieved?” he inquired, looking very serious."
768,
768,“She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.”
768,
768,"“Well, _I_ cried last night,” he returned, “and I had more reason to"
768,cry than she.”
768,
768,“Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an
768,"empty stomach,” said I. “Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves."
768,"But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind,"
768,"when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say—you"
768,"know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought"
768,"her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I"
768,"have dinner to get ready, I’ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar"
768,Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are
768,"younger, and yet, I’ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad"
768,across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don’t
768,you feel that you could?”
768,
768,"Heathcliff’s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and"
768,he sighed.
768,
768,"“But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn’t make him"
768,"less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,"
768,"and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich"
768,as he will be!”
768,
768,"“And cried for mamma at every turn,” I added, “and trembled if a"
768,"country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a"
768,"shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to"
768,"the glass, and I’ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those"
768,"two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of"
768,"rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so"
768,"deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting"
768,"under them, like devil’s spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly"
768,"wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to"
768,"confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always"
768,seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don’t get the
768,expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are
768,"its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for"
768,what it suffers.”
768,
768,"“In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton’s great blue eyes and"
768,"even forehead,” he replied. “I do—and that won’t help me to them.”"
768,
768,"“A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,” I continued, “if"
768,you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into
768,"something worse than ugly. And now that we’ve done washing, and"
768,"combing, and sulking—tell me whether you don’t think yourself rather"
768,"handsome? I’ll tell you, I do. You’re fit for a prince in disguise. Who"
768,"knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian"
768,"queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week’s income, Wuthering"
768,Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by
768,"wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would"
768,frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should
768,give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little
768,farmer!”
768,
768,So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to
768,"look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted"
768,by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran
768,"to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons"
768,"descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the"
768,Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in
768,"winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them"
768,"into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour"
768,into their white faces.
768,
768,"I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he"
768,"willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the"
768,"door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the"
768,"other. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and"
768,"cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved"
768,"him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph “keep the fellow"
768,out of the room—send him into the garret till dinner is over. He’ll be
768,"cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone"
768,with them a minute.”
768,
768,"“Nay, sir,” I could not avoid answering, “he’ll touch nothing, not he:"
768,and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.”
768,
768,"“He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till"
768,"dark,” cried Hindley. “Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting"
768,"the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks—see"
768,if I won’t pull them a bit longer!”
768,
768,"“They are long enough already,” observed Master Linton, peeping from"
768,the doorway; “I wonder they don’t make his head ache. It’s like a
768,colt’s mane over his eyes!”
768,
768,He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but
768,Heathcliff’s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance
768,"of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival."
768,"He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under"
768,"his gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker’s face and neck; who"
768,instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine
768,hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly
768,"and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a"
768,"rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and"
768,"breathless. I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed"
768,"Edgar’s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His"
768,"sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded,"
768,blushing for all.
768,
768,“You should not have spoken to him!” she expostulated with Master
768,"Linton. “He was in a bad temper, and now you’ve spoilt your visit; and"
768,he’ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can’t eat my dinner. Why
768,"did you speak to him, Edgar?”"
768,
768,"“I didn’t,” sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the"
768,remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. “I
768,"promised mamma that I wouldn’t say one word to him, and I didn’t.”"
768,
768,"“Well, don’t cry,” replied Catherine, contemptuously; “you’re not"
768,"killed. Don’t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush,"
768,Isabella! Has anybody hurt _you?_”
768,
768,"“There, there, children—to your seats!” cried Hindley, bustling in."
768,"“That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar,"
768,take the law into your own fists—it will give you an appetite!”
768,
768,The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant
768,"feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no"
768,"real harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls,"
768,and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her
768,"chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an"
768,"indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her."
768,"“An unfeeling child,” I thought to myself; “how lightly she dismisses"
768,her old playmate’s troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so
768,selfish.” She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down
768,"again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped"
768,"her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her"
768,emotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in
768,"purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of"
768,"getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been"
768,"locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce"
768,to him a private mess of victuals.
768,
768,In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated
768,"then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and"
768,I was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in
768,"the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the"
768,"arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a"
768,"trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides"
768,"singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive"
768,"contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to"
768,"hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs"
768,"and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty."
768,
768,Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of
768,"the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house"
768,"door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She"
768,"made no stay at the stairs’-head, but mounted farther, to the garret"
768,"where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined"
768,"answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to"
768,hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things
768,"converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and"
768,the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to
768,"warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The"
768,"little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,"
768,"into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I"
768,"could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,"
768,"and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my"
768,"fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour’s, to be removed from the sound"
768,"of our “devil’s psalmody,” as it pleased him to call it. I told them I"
768,intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had
768,"never broken his fast since yesterday’s dinner, I would wink at his"
768,cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the
768,"fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and"
768,"could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He"
768,"leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and"
768,remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his
768,"thoughts, he answered gravely—“I’m trying to settle how I shall pay"
768,"Hindley back. I don’t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at"
768,last. I hope he will not die before I do!”
768,
768,"“For shame, Heathcliff!” said I. “It is for God to punish wicked"
768,people; we should learn to forgive.”
768,
768,"“No, God won’t have the satisfaction that I shall,” he returned. “I"
768,"only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I’ll plan it out:"
768,while I’m thinking of that I don’t feel pain.”
768,
768,"But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I’m annoyed"
768,how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel
768,"cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff’s history,"
768,"all that you need hear, in half a dozen words."
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay"
768,"aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I"
768,"was very far from nodding. “Sit still, Mrs. Dean,” I cried; “do sit"
768,still another half-hour. You’ve done just right to tell the story
768,leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the
768,"same style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more"
768,or less.”
768,
768,"“The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.”"
768,
768,“No matter—I’m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or
768,two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.”
768,
768,“You shouldn’t lie till ten. There’s the very prime of the morning gone
768,long before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day’s
768,"work by ten o’clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.”"
768,
768,"“Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend"
768,lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an
768,"obstinate cold, at least.”"
768,
768,"“I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three"
768,years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw—”
768,
768,"“No, no, I’ll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the"
768,"mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking"
768,"its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so"
768,intently that puss’s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of
768,temper?”
768,
768,"“A terribly lazy mood, I should say.”"
768,
768,"“On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,"
768,"therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions"
768,acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does
768,"over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the"
768,deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the
768,"looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less"
768,"in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love"
768,for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love
768,of a year’s standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to
768,"a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do"
768,"it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French"
768,cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but
768,each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.”
768,
768,"“Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,”"
768,"observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech."
768,
768,"“Excuse me,” I responded; “you, my good friend, are a striking evidence"
768,against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight
768,"consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to"
768,consider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great
768,deal more than the generality of servants think. You have been
768,compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions
768,for frittering your life away in silly trifles.”
768,
768,Mrs. Dean laughed.
768,
768,"“I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,” she"
768,said; “not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of
768,"faces, and one series of actions, from year’s end to year’s end; but I"
768,"have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then,"
768,"I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open"
768,"a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something"
768,"out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of"
768,French; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can
768,"expect of a poor man’s daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in"
768,"true gossip’s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three"
768,"years, I will be content to pass to the next summer—the summer of 1778,"
768,that is nearly twenty-three years ago.”

768,
768,CHAPTER VIII
768,
768,
768,"On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and"
768,"the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the"
768,"hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our"
768,breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the
768,"lane, calling me as she ran."
768,
768,"“Oh, such a grand bairn!” she panted out. “The finest lad that ever"
768,breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she’s been in a
768,consumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now
768,"she has nothing to keep her, and she’ll be dead before winter. You must"
768,"come home directly. You’re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar"
768,"and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because"
768,it will be all yours when there is no missis!”
768,
768,"“But is she very ill?” I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my"
768,bonnet.
768,
768,"“I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,” replied the girl, “and she"
768,talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She’s out of
768,"her head for joy, it’s such a beauty! If I were her I’m certain I"
768,"should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite"
768,of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub
768,"down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when"
768,"the old croaker steps forward, and says he—‘Earnshaw, it’s a blessing"
768,"your wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt"
768,"convinced we shouldn’t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the"
768,"winter will probably finish her. Don’t take on, and fret about it too"
768,"much: it can’t be helped. And besides, you should have known better"
768,than to choose such a rush of a lass!’”
768,
768,“And what did the master answer?” I inquired.
768,
768,"“I think he swore: but I didn’t mind him, I was straining to see the"
768,"bairn,” and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous"
768,"as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was"
768,very sad for Hindley’s sake. He had room in his heart only for two
768,"idols—his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I"
768,couldn’t conceive how he would bear the loss.
768,
768,"When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door;"
768,"and, as I passed in, I asked, “how was the baby?”"
768,
768,"“Nearly ready to run about, Nell!” he replied, putting on a cheerful"
768,smile.
768,
768,“And the mistress?” I ventured to inquire; “the doctor says she’s—”
768,
768,"“Damn the doctor!” he interrupted, reddening. “Frances is quite right:"
768,she’ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going
768,"upstairs? will you tell her that I’ll come, if she’ll promise not to"
768,talk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she
768,must—tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.”
768,
768,I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty
768,"spirits, and replied merrily, “I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there"
768,"he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won’t speak: but"
768,that does not bind me not to laugh at him!”
768,
768,Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed
768,"her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming"
768,her health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his
768,"medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn’t put"
768,"him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, “I know you need"
768,not—she’s well—she does not want any more attendance from you! She
768,never was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse
768,"is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.”"
768,
768,"He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one"
768,"night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought"
768,"she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her—a"
768,very slight one—he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about
768,"his neck, her face changed, and she was dead."
768,
768,"As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my"
768,"hands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him"
768,"cry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew"
768,desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither
768,"wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave"
768,himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his
768,tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that
768,"would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you"
768,"know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more"
768,readily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants
768,and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had
768,plenty of wickedness to reprove.
768,
768,The master’s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for
768,Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to
768,"make a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_"
768,possessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to
768,witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily
768,more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell
768,"what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody"
768,"decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton’s visits to Miss"
768,Cathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the
768,"country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty,"
768,"headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;"
768,and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she
768,"never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to"
768,old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections
768,"unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it"
768,difficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master:
768,"that is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side,"
768,"and his wife’s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you"
768,might see something of what she was. Can you make that out?
768,
768,"Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,"
768,"exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive"
768,and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light
768,hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious;
768,the figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw
768,could forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much
768,"how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea"
768,of Catherine Earnshaw.
768,
768,"“A very agreeable portrait,” I observed to the house-keeper. “Is it"
768,like?”
768,
768,"“Yes,” she answered; “but he looked better when he was animated; that"
768,is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.”
768,
768,Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her
768,five-weeks’ residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show
768,"her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of"
768,"being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed"
768,unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;
768,"gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her"
768,brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first—for she was
768,full of ambition—and led her to adopt a double character without
768,exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard
768,"Heathcliff termed a “vulgar young ruffian,” and “worse than a brute,”"
768,she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small
768,"inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and"
768,restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor
768,praise.
768,
768,Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He
768,"had a terror of Earnshaw’s reputation, and shrunk from encountering"
768,him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility:
768,"the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if"
768,"he could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his"
768,"appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful,"
768,"never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two"
768,friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of
768,"Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his"
768,"absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff,"
768,"she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if"
768,depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.
768,"I’ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which"
768,she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but
768,"she was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses,"
768,"till she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself,"
768,"finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else"
768,that she might fashion into an adviser.
768,
768,"Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed"
768,to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age
768,"of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being"
768,"deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward"
768,and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.
768,"In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early"
768,"education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had"
768,"extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,"
768,and any love for books or learning. His childhood’s sense of
768,"superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was"
768,faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in
768,"her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he"
768,yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step
768,"in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink"
768,beneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with
768,mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look;
768,his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost
768,"idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure,"
768,"apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few"
768,acquaintance.
768,
768,Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of
768,respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her
768,"in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses,"
768,as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks
768,of affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the
768,"house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting"
768,Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it
768,into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place
768,"to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her"
768,"brother’s absence, and was then preparing to receive him."
768,
768,"“Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?” asked Heathcliff. “Are you going"
768,anywhere?”
768,
768,"“No, it is raining,” she answered."
768,
768,"“Why have you that silk frock on, then?” he said. “Nobody coming here,"
768,I hope?”
768,
768,"“Not that I know of,” stammered Miss: “but you should be in the field"
768,"now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were"
768,gone.”
768,
768,"“Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,” observed"
768,the boy. “I’ll not work any more to-day: I’ll stay with you.”
768,
768,"“Oh, but Joseph will tell,” she suggested; “you’d better go!”"
768,
768,“Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will
768,"take him till dark, and he’ll never know.”"
768,
768,"So saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected"
768,"an instant, with knitted brows—she found it needful to smooth the way"
768,for an intrusion. “Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this
768,"afternoon,” she said, at the conclusion of a minute’s silence. “As it"
768,"rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run"
768,the risk of being scolded for no good.”
768,
768,"“Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,” he persisted; “don’t turn"
768,"me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I’m on the point,"
768,"sometimes, of complaining that they—but I’ll not—”"
768,
768,"“That they what?” cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled"
768,"countenance. “Oh, Nelly!” she added petulantly, jerking her head away"
768,"from my hands, “you’ve combed my hair quite out of curl! That’s enough;"
768,"let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about,"
768,Heathcliff?”
768,
768,“Nothing—only look at the almanack on that wall;” he pointed to a
768,"framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, “The crosses are"
768,"for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those"
768,spent with me. Do you see? I’ve marked every day.”
768,
768,"“Yes—very foolish: as if I took notice!” replied Catherine, in a"
768,peevish tone. “And where is the sense of that?”
768,
768,"“To show that I _do_ take notice,” said Heathcliff."
768,
768,"“And should I always be sitting with you?” she demanded, growing more"
768,irritated. “What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be
768,"dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you"
768,"do, either!”"
768,
768,"“You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you"
768,"disliked my company, Cathy!” exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation."
768,
768,"“It’s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,” she"
768,muttered.
768,
768,"Her companion rose up, but he hadn’t time to express his feelings"
768,"further, for a horse’s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked"
768,"gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the"
768,unexpected summons he had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the
768,"difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out."
768,"The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal"
768,country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were
768,"as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and"
768,"pronounced his words as you do: that’s less gruff than we talk here,"
768,and softer.
768,
768,"“I’m not come too soon, am I?” he said, casting a look at me: I had"
768,"begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the"
768,dresser.
768,
768,"“No,” answered Catherine. “What are you doing there, Nelly?”"
768,
768,"“My work, Miss,” I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to"
768,make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)
768,
768,"She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, “Take yourself and your"
768,"dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don’t commence"
768,scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!”
768,
768,"“It’s a good opportunity, now that master is away,” I answered aloud:"
768,“he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I’m
768,sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.”
768,
768,"“I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,” exclaimed the young lady"
768,"imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to"
768,recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.
768,
768,"“I’m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,” was my response; and I proceeded"
768,assiduously with my occupation.
768,
768,"She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my"
768,"hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the"
768,"arm. I’ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her"
768,"vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up"
768,"from my knees, and screamed out, “Oh, Miss, that’s a nasty trick! You"
768,"have no right to nip me, and I’m not going to bear it.”"
768,
768,"“I didn’t touch you, you lying creature!” cried she, her fingers"
768,"tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had"
768,"power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a"
768,blaze.
768,
768,"“What’s that, then?” I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to"
768,refute her.
768,
768,"She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled"
768,"by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging"
768,blow that filled both eyes with water.
768,
768,"“Catherine, love! Catherine!” interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the"
768,double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.
768,
768,"“Leave the room, Ellen!” she repeated, trembling all over."
768,
768,"Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on"
768,"the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out"
768,"complaints against “wicked aunt Cathy,” which drew her fury on to his"
768,"unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor"
768,"child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to"
768,"deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young"
768,man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be
768,mistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in
768,"my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of"
768,"communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle"
768,their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had
768,"laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip."
768,
768,“That’s right!” I said to myself. “Take warning and begone! It’s a
768,kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.”
768,
768,"“Where are you going?” demanded Catherine, advancing to the door."
768,
768,"He swerved aside, and attempted to pass."
768,
768,"“You must not go!” she exclaimed, energetically."
768,
768,“I must and shall!” he replied in a subdued voice.
768,
768,"“No,” she persisted, grasping the handle; “not yet, Edgar Linton: sit"
768,down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all
768,"night, and I won’t be miserable for you!”"
768,
768,“Can I stay after you have struck me?” asked Linton.
768,
768,Catherine was mute.
768,
768,"“You’ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,” he continued; “I’ll not"
768,come here again!”
768,
768,Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.
768,
768,“And you told a deliberate untruth!” he said.
768,
768,"“I didn’t!” she cried, recovering her speech; “I did nothing"
768,"deliberately. Well, go, if you please—get away! And now I’ll cry—I’ll"
768,cry myself sick!”
768,
768,"She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious"
768,earnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there
768,he lingered. I resolved to encourage him.
768,
768,"“Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,” I called out. “As bad as any marred"
768,"child: you’d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to"
768,grieve us.”
768,
768,The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the
768,power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse
768,"half killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no"
768,"saving him: he’s doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he"
768,"turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind"
768,him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had
768,"come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears"
768,"(his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had"
768,merely effected a closer intimacy—had broken the outworks of youthful
768,"timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and"
768,confess themselves lovers.
768,
768,Intelligence of Mr. Hindley’s arrival drove Linton speedily to his
768,"horse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and"
768,"to take the shot out of the master’s fowling-piece, which he was fond"
768,"of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of"
768,"any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit"
768,"upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did"
768,go the length of firing the gun.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER IX
768,
768,
768,"He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the"
768,act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was
768,impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild
768,beast’s fondness or his madman’s rage; for in one he ran a chance of
768,"being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung"
768,"into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained"
768,perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.
768,
768,"“There, I’ve found it out at last!” cried Hindley, pulling me back by"
768,"the skin of my neck, like a dog. “By heaven and hell, you’ve sworn"
768,"between you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is"
768,"always out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you"
768,"swallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn’t laugh; for I’ve just"
768,"crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is"
768,the same as one—and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest
768,till I do!”
768,
768,"“But I don’t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,” I answered; “it has"
768,"been cutting red herrings. I’d rather be shot, if you please.”"
768,
768,“You’d rather be damned!” he said; “and so you shall. No law in England
768,"can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine’s abominable!"
768,Open your mouth.”
768,
768,"He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth:"
768,"but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out,"
768,and affirmed it tasted detestably—I would not take it on any account.
768,
768,"“Oh!” said he, releasing me, “I see that hideous little villain is not"
768,"Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive"
768,"for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin."
768,"Unnatural cub, come hither! I’ll teach thee to impose on a"
768,"good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don’t you think the lad would be"
768,"handsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something"
768,"fierce—get me a scissors—something fierce and trim! Besides, it’s"
768,"infernal affectation—devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears—we’re"
768,"asses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my"
768,"darling! wisht, dry thy eyes—there’s a joy; kiss me. What! it won’t?"
768,"Kiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a"
768,"monster! As sure as I’m living, I’ll break the brat’s neck.”"
768,
768,Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father’s arms with all
768,"his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and"
768,lifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the
768,"child into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley"
768,leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost
768,"forgetting what he had in his hands. “Who is that?” he asked, hearing"
768,"some one approaching the stairs’-foot. I leant forward also, for the"
768,"purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come"
768,"further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a"
768,"sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him,"
768,and fell.
768,
768,There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw
768,that the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at
768,"the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and"
768,"setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the"
768,accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five
768,"shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand"
768,"pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding"
768,"the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words"
768,"could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument"
768,"of thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have"
768,tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton’s skull on the steps;
768,"but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my"
768,"precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely,"
768,sobered and abashed.
768,
768,"“It is your fault, Ellen,” he said; “you should have kept him out of"
768,sight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?”
768,
768,"“Injured!” I cried angrily; “if he is not killed, he’ll be an idiot!"
768,Oh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use
768,him. You’re worse than a heathen—treating your own flesh and blood in
768,that manner!”
768,
768,"He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me,"
768,sobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on
768,"him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if"
768,he would go into convulsions.
768,
768,“You shall not meddle with him!” I continued. “He hates you—they all
768,hate you—that’s the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state
768,you’re come to!”
768,
768,"“I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,” laughed the misguided man,"
768,"recovering his hardness. “At present, convey yourself and him away. And"
768,"hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I"
768,"wouldn’t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:"
768,but that’s as my fancy goes.”
768,
768,"While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and"
768,poured some into a tumbler.
768,
768,"“Nay, don’t!” I entreated. “Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on"
768,"this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!”"
768,
768,"“Any one will do better for him than I shall,” he answered."
768,
768,"“Have mercy on your own soul!” I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass"
768,from his hand.
768,
768,"“Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to"
768,"perdition to punish its Maker,” exclaimed the blasphemer. “Here’s to"
768,its hearty damnation!”
768,
768,He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his
768,command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or
768,remember.
768,
768,"“It’s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,” observed Heathcliff,"
768,muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. “He’s doing
768,his very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he
768,"would wager his mare that he’ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton,"
768,and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the
768,common course befall him.”
768,
768,"I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep."
768,"Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out"
768,"afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when"
768,"he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and"
768,remained silent.
768,
768,"I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,—"
768,
768,"It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,"
768,"The mither beneath the mools heard that,"
768,
768,
768,"when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her"
768,"head in, and whispered,—“Are you alone, Nelly?”"
768,
768,"“Yes, Miss,” I replied."
768,
768,"She entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to"
768,"say something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed"
768,"and anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and"
768,she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I
768,resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.
768,
768,"“Where’s Heathcliff?” she said, interrupting me."
768,
768,"“About his work in the stable,” was my answer."
768,
768,He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There
768,"followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two"
768,trickle from Catherine’s cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her
768,shameful conduct?—I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may
768,"come to the point as she will—I sha’n’t help her! No, she felt small"
768,"trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns."
768,
768,"“Oh, dear!” she cried at last. “I’m very unhappy!”"
768,
768,"“A pity,” observed I. “You’re hard to please; so many friends and so"
768,"few cares, and can’t make yourself content!”"
768,
768,"“Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?” she pursued, kneeling down by"
768,"me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look"
768,"which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the"
768,world to indulge it.
768,
768,"“Is it worth keeping?” I inquired, less sulkily."
768,
768,"“Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I"
768,"should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I’ve"
768,"given him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or"
768,"denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.”"
768,
768,"“Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?” I replied. “To be sure,"
768,considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this
768,"afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked"
768,"you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome"
768,fool.”
768,
768,"“If you talk so, I won’t tell you any more,” she returned, peevishly"
768,"rising to her feet. “I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I"
768,was wrong!”
768,
768,“You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have
768,"pledged your word, and cannot retract.”"
768,
768,“But say whether I should have done so—do!” she exclaimed in an
768,"irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning."
768,
768,“There are many things to be considered before that question can be
768,"answered properly,” I said, sententiously. “First and foremost, do you"
768,love Mr. Edgar?”
768,
768,"“Who can help it? Of course I do,” she answered."
768,
768,Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of
768,twenty-two it was not injudicious.
768,
768,"“Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?”"
768,
768,"“Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.”"
768,
768,“By no means; you must say why?”
768,
768,"“Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.”"
768,
768,“Bad!” was my commentary.
768,
768,“And because he is young and cheerful.”
768,
768,"“Bad, still.”"
768,
768,“And because he loves me.”
768,
768,"“Indifferent, coming there.”"
768,
768,"“And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the"
768,"neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.”"
768,
768,"“Worst of all. And now, say how you love him?”"
768,
768,"“As everybody loves—You’re silly, Nelly.”"
768,
768,“Not at all—Answer.”
768,
768,"“I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and"
768,"everything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks,"
768,"and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!”"
768,
768,“And why?”
768,
768,“Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It’s
768,"no jest to me!” said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to"
768,the fire.
768,
768,"“I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,” I replied. “You love Mr."
768,"Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and"
768,"loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him"
768,"without that, probably; and with it you wouldn’t, unless he possessed"
768,the four former attractions.”
768,
768,"“No, to be sure not: I should only pity him—hate him, perhaps, if he"
768,"were ugly, and a clown.”"
768,
768,"“But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:"
768,"handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from"
768,loving them?”
768,
768,"“If there be any, they are out of my way: I’ve seen none like Edgar.”"
768,
768,"“You may see some; and he won’t always be handsome, and young, and may"
768,not always be rich.”
768,
768,“He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would
768,speak rationally.”
768,
768,"“Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry"
768,Mr. Linton.”
768,
768,“I don’t want your permission for that—I _shall_ marry him: and yet you
768,have not told me whether I’m right.”
768,
768,“Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And
768,"now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be"
768,"pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will"
768,"escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable"
768,"one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and"
768,easy: where is the obstacle?”
768,
768,"“_Here_! and _here_!” replied Catherine, striking one hand on her"
768,"forehead, and the other on her breast: “in whichever place the soul"
768,"lives. In my soul and in my heart, I’m convinced I’m wrong!”"
768,
768,“That’s very strange! I cannot make it out.”
768,
768,"“It’s my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I’ll explain it: I"
768,can’t do it distinctly; but I’ll give you a feeling of how I feel.”
768,
768,"She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,"
768,and her clasped hands trembled.
768,
768,"“Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?” she said, suddenly, after"
768,some minutes’ reflection.
768,
768,"“Yes, now and then,” I answered."
768,
768,“And so do I. I’ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me
768,"ever after, and changed my ideas: they’ve gone through and through me,"
768,"like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is"
768,one: I’m going to tell it—but take care not to smile at any part of
768,it.”
768,
768,"“Oh! don’t, Miss Catherine!” I cried. “We’re dismal enough without"
768,"conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and"
768,like yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he’s_ dreaming nothing dreary.
768,How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!”
768,
768,“Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember
768,"him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:"
768,"nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to"
768,listen: it’s not long; and I’ve no power to be merry to-night.”
768,
768,"“I won’t hear it, I won’t hear it!” I repeated, hastily."
768,
768,"I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had"
768,"an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which"
768,"I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was"
768,"vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject,"
768,she recommenced in a short time.
768,
768,"“If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.”"
768,
768,"“Because you are not fit to go there,” I answered. “All sinners would"
768,be miserable in heaven.”
768,
768,“But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.”
768,
768,"“I tell you I won’t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I’ll go to"
768,"bed,” I interrupted again."
768,
768,"She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair."
768,
768,"“This is nothing,” cried she: “I was only going to say that heaven did"
768,not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back
768,to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the
768,middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke
768,"sobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the"
768,other. I’ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in
768,heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so
768,"low, I shouldn’t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry"
768,"Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not"
768,"because he’s handsome, Nelly, but because he’s more myself than I am."
768,"Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton’s"
768,"is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.”"
768,
768,Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff’s presence.
768,"Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise"
768,"from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he"
768,"heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he"
768,"stayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was"
768,prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or
768,"departure; but I started, and bade her hush!"
768,
768,"“Why?” she asked, gazing nervously round."
768,
768,"“Joseph is here,” I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his"
768,cartwheels up the road; “and Heathcliff will come in with him. I’m not
768,sure whether he were not at the door this moment.”
768,
768,"“Oh, he couldn’t overhear me at the door!” said she. “Give me Hareton,"
768,"while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you."
768,"I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that"
768,"Heathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does"
768,not know what being in love is!”
768,
768,"“I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,” I returned;"
768,"“and if _you_ are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature"
768,"that ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,"
768,"and love, and all! Have you considered how you’ll bear the separation,"
768,"and how he’ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss"
768,Catherine—”
768,
768,"“He quite deserted! we separated!” she exclaimed, with an accent of"
768,"indignation. “Who is to separate us, pray? They’ll meet the fate of"
768,"Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every"
768,Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could
768,"consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that’s not what I intend—that’s not"
768,what I mean! I shouldn’t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!
768,He’ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must
768,"shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he"
768,"learns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a"
768,selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I
768,"married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid"
768,"Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power.”"
768,
768,"“With your husband’s money, Miss Catherine?” I asked. “You’ll find him"
768,"not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I’m hardly a judge, I"
768,think that’s the worst motive you’ve given yet for being the wife of
768,young Linton.”
768,
768,"“It is not,” retorted she; “it is the best! The others were the"
768,"satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar’s sake, too, to satisfy him."
768,This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings
768,to Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody
768,have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond
768,"you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained"
768,"here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff’s miseries,"
768,and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in
768,"living is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should"
768,"still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were"
768,"annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not"
768,seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods:
768,"time will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My"
768,love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of
768,"little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He’s"
768,"always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always"
768,"a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don’t talk of our"
768,separation again: it is impracticable; and—”
768,
768,"She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it"
768,forcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly!
768,
768,"“If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,” I said, “it only goes"
768,to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in
768,"marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble"
768,me with no more secrets: I’ll not promise to keep them.”
768,
768,"“You’ll keep that?” she asked, eagerly."
768,
768,"“No, I’ll not promise,” I repeated."
768,
768,"She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our"
768,"conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed"
768,"Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my"
768,fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr.
768,Hindley; and we didn’t settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came
768,"to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we"
768,feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time
768,alone.
768,
768,"“And how isn’t that nowt comed in fro’ th’ field, be this time? What is"
768,"he about? girt idle seeght!” demanded the old man, looking round for"
768,Heathcliff.
768,
768,"“I’ll call him,” I replied. “He’s in the barn, I’ve no doubt.”"
768,
768,"I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to"
768,"Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure;"
768,and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her
768,"brother’s conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung"
768,"Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not"
768,"taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk"
768,would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph
768,proposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were
768,staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They
768,"were “ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,” he affirmed. And on their"
768,behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual
768,"quarter-of-an-hour’s supplication before meat, and would have tacked"
768,"another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in"
768,"upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and,"
768,"wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!"
768,
768,"“I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,” she said."
768,“And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not
768,"reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.”"
768,
768,"Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to"
768,"suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and"
768,"walked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the"
768,"floor, exclaiming—“I wonder where he is—I wonder where he _can_ be!"
768,"What did I say, Nelly? I’ve forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour"
768,this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I’ve said to grieve him? I do wish
768,he’d come. I do wish he would!”
768,
768,"“What a noise for nothing!” I cried, though rather uneasy myself. “What"
768,a trifle scares you! It’s surely no great cause of alarm that
768,"Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie"
768,too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I’ll engage he’s lurking
768,there. See if I don’t ferret him out!”
768,
768,"I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and"
768,Joseph’s quest ended in the same.
768,
768,“Yon lad gets war und war!” observed he on re-entering. “He’s left th’
768,"gate at t’ full swing, and Miss’s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o’"
768,"corn, and plottered through, raight o’er into t’ meadow! Hahsomdiver,"
768,"t’ maister ’ull play t’ devil to-morn, and he’ll do weel. He’s patience"
768,"itsseln wi’ sich careless, offald craters—patience itsseln he is! Bud"
768,"he’ll not be soa allus—yah’s see, all on ye! Yah mun’n’t drive him out"
768,of his heead for nowt!”
768,
768,"“Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?” interrupted Catherine. “Have you"
768,"been looking for him, as I ordered?”"
768,
768,"“I sud more likker look for th’ horse,” he replied. “It ’ud be to more"
768,sense. Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike
768,this—as black as t’ chimbley! und Heathcliff’s noan t’ chap to coom at
768,_my_ whistle—happen he’ll be less hard o’ hearing wi’ _ye_!”
768,
768,It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined
768,"to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain"
768,"would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However,"
768,Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering
768,"to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which"
768,permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one
768,"side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations"
768,"and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash"
768,"around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and"
768,"then crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good"
768,passionate fit of crying.
768,
768,"About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the"
768,"Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and"
768,either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building:
768,"a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the"
768,"east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the"
768,kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and
768,"Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the"
768,"patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,"
768,though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a
768,"judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I"
768,shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet
768,"living. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion"
768,"vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might"
768,be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But
768,"the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;"
768,"excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in"
768,"refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to"
768,catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in
768,"and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to"
768,"the back, and putting her hands before it."
768,
768,"“Well, Miss!” I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; “you are not bent on"
768,"getting your death, are you? Do you know what o’clock it is? Half-past"
768,"twelve. Come, come to bed! there’s no use waiting any longer on that"
768,"foolish boy: he’ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he’ll stay there now. He"
768,"guesses we shouldn’t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he"
768,guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he’d rather avoid having
768,the door opened by the master.”
768,
768,"“Nay, nay, he’s noan at Gimmerton,” said Joseph. “I’s niver wonder but"
768,"he’s at t’ bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn’t for nowt, and"
768,"I wod hev’ ye to look out, Miss—yah muh be t’ next. Thank Hivin for"
768,"all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out"
768,fro’ th’ rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t’ Scripture ses.” And he began
768,"quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we"
768,might find them.
768,
768,"I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet"
768,"things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed"
768,"with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping"
768,round him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I
768,"distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep."
768,
768,"Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing"
768,"the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the"
768,"fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its"
768,"unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen"
768,"hearth, haggard and drowsy."
768,
768,"“What ails you, Cathy?” he was saying when I entered: “you look as"
768,"dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?”"
768,
768,"“I’ve been wet,” she answered reluctantly, “and I’m cold, that’s all.”"
768,
768,"“Oh, she is naughty!” I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably"
768,"sober. “She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there"
768,"she has sat the night through, and I couldn’t prevail on her to stir.”"
768,
768,"Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. “The night through,” he"
768,"repeated. “What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was"
768,over hours since.”
768,
768,"Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff’s absence, as long as we"
768,"could conceal it; so I replied, I didn’t know how she took it into her"
768,head to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I
768,"threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents"
768,"from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, “Ellen, shut the"
768,window. I’m starving!” And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to
768,the almost extinguished embers.
768,
768,"“She’s ill,” said Hindley, taking her wrist; “I suppose that’s the"
768,reason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don’t want to be troubled
768,with more sickness here. What took you into the rain?”
768,
768,"“Running after t’ lads, as usuald!” croaked Joseph, catching an"
768,opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. “If I war
768,"yah, maister, I’d just slam t’ boards i’ their faces all on ’em, gentle"
768,"and simple! Never a day ut yah’re off, but yon cat o’ Linton comes"
768,"sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo’s a fine lass! shoo sits watching"
768,"for ye i’ t’ kitchen; and as yah’re in at one door, he’s out at"
768,"t’other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side! It’s"
768,"bonny behaviour, lurking amang t’ fields, after twelve o’ t’ night, wi’"
768,"that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think _I’m_"
768,blind; but I’m noan: nowt ut t’ soart!—I seed young Linton boath coming
768,"and going, and I seed _yah_” (directing his discourse to me), “yah"
768,"gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th’ house, t’"
768,minute yah heard t’ maister’s horse-fit clatter up t’ road.”
768,
768,"“Silence, eavesdropper!” cried Catherine; “none of your insolence"
768,"before me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was"
768,_I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have
768,met him as you were.”
768,
768,"“You lie, Cathy, no doubt,” answered her brother, “and you are a"
768,"confounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were"
768,"you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not"
768,"be afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me"
768,a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of
768,"breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business"
768,"this very morning; and after he’s gone, I’d advise you all to look"
768,sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.”
768,
768,"“I never saw Heathcliff last night,” answered Catherine, beginning to"
768,"sob bitterly: “and if you do turn him out of doors, I’ll go with him."
768,"But, perhaps, you’ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he’s gone.”"
768,"Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her"
768,words were inarticulate.
768,
768,"Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get"
768,"to her room immediately, or she shouldn’t cry for nothing! I obliged"
768,her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we
768,"reached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and"
768,I begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of
768,"delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her"
768,"dangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let"
768,"her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw"
768,herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had
768,"enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary"
768,distance between cottage and cottage.
768,
768,"Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master"
768,"were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong"
768,"as a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid"
768,"us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded"
768,"and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted"
768,on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were
768,very grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness:
768,"she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of"
768,each other.
768,
768,"Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and"
768,haughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the
768,"evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when"
768,"she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance"
768,"on her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period,"
768,"for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save"
768,in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he
768,"_would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a"
768,"little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and"
768,thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with
768,consideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear
768,crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less
768,than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and
768,contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof;
768,"and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often"
768,"attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to"
768,"demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was"
768,"rather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,"
768,but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the
768,"family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him"
768,"alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar"
768,"Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was"
768,infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he
768,"led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father’s"
768,death.
768,
768,"Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights"
768,"and accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I"
768,had just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but
768,"Catherine’s tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go,"
768,"and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting"
768,to her husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the
768,"latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,"
768,"now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should"
768,"take him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as"
768,I was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only
768,"to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and"
768,"since then he has been a stranger: and it’s very queer to think it, but"
768,"I’ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and"
768,that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,At this point of the housekeeper’s story she chanced to glance towards
768,the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the
768,minute-hand measure half-past one. She would not hear of staying a
768,"second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of"
768,"her narrative myself. And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I"
768,"have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go"
768,"also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs."

768,CHAPTER X
768,
768,
768,"A charming introduction to a hermit’s life! Four weeks’ torture,"
768,"tossing, and sickness! Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,"
768,"and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And oh, this"
768,"dearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible"
768,intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till
768,spring!
768,
768,Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call. About seven days ago
768,he sent me a brace of grouse—the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is
768,not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a
768,"great mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was"
768,"charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some"
768,"other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is"
768,quite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could
768,enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her
768,"tale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes:"
768,"I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three"
768,years; and the heroine was married. I’ll ring: she’ll be delighted to
768,find me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.
768,
768,"“It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,” she commenced."
768,
768,"“Away, away with it!” I replied; “I desire to have—”"
768,
768,“The doctor says you must drop the powders.”
768,
768,“With all my heart! Don’t interrupt me. Come and take your seat here.
768,Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting
768,out of your pocket—that will do—now continue the history of Mr.
768,"Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish"
768,"his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he"
768,"get a sizar’s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours"
768,by drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more
768,promptly on the English highways?”
768,
768,"“He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I"
768,couldn’t give my word for any. I stated before that I didn’t know how
768,he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise
768,"his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with"
768,"your leave, I’ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse"
768,and not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?”
768,
768,“Much.”
768,
768,“That’s good news.”
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my"
768,"agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to"
768,expect. She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his
768,sister she showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to
768,"her comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the"
768,"honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no"
768,"mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who"
768,_can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither
768,opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr. Edgar had a
768,deep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but
768,"if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow"
768,"cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a"
768,frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a
768,time spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab
768,of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing
768,"his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less"
768,"touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as"
768,"harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine"
768,had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with
768,"sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration"
768,"in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never"
768,subject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was
768,welcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that
768,they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.
768,
768,"It ended. Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild"
768,and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it
768,ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one’s interest
768,was not the chief consideration in the other’s thoughts. On a mellow
768,"evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket"
768,"of apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon"
768,"looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to"
768,lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the
768,"building. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and"
768,"lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet"
768,"air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I"
768,"heard a voice behind me say,—“Nelly, is that you?”"
768,
768,"It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in"
768,the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I
768,"turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut,"
768,and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in
768,"the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in"
768,"dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and"
768,held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. “Who
768,"can it be?” I thought. “Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no"
768,resemblance to his.”
768,
768,"“I have waited here an hour,” he resumed, while I continued staring;"
768,“and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I
768,"dared not enter. You do not know me? Look, I’m not a stranger!”"
768,
768,"A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered"
768,"with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and"
768,singular. I remembered the eyes.
768,
768,"“What!” I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,"
768,and I raised my hands in amazement. “What! you come back? Is it really
768,you? Is it?”
768,
768,"“Yes, Heathcliff,” he replied, glancing from me up to the windows,"
768,"which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from"
768,"within. “Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you"
768,needn’t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word
768,"with her—your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires"
768,to see her.”
768,
768,“How will she take it?” I exclaimed. “What will she do? The surprise
768,bewilders me—it will put her out of her head! And you _are_ Heathcliff!
768,"But altered! Nay, there’s no comprehending it. Have you been for a"
768,soldier?”
768,
768,"“Go and carry my message,” he interrupted, impatiently. “I’m in hell"
768,till you do!”
768,
768,"He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where"
768,"Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At"
768,length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the
768,"candles lighted, and I opened the door."
768,
768,"They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,"
768,"and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the"
768,"valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top"
768,"(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the"
768,sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of
768,the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our
768,old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both
768,"the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked"
768,wondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand;
768,"and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my"
768,"question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to"
768,"return, and mutter, “A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma’am.”"
768,
768,“What does he want?” asked Mrs. Linton.
768,
768,"“I did not question him,” I answered."
768,
768,"“Well, close the curtains, Nelly,” she said; “and bring up tea. I’ll be"
768,back again directly.”
768,
768,"She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was."
768,
768,"“Some one mistress does not expect,” I replied. “That Heathcliff—you"
768,"recollect him, sir—who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw’s.”"
768,
768,“What! the gipsy—the ploughboy?” he cried. “Why did you not say so to
768,Catherine?”
768,
768,"“Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,” I said. “She’d be"
768,sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.
768,I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.”
768,
768,Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that
768,"overlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they"
768,"were below, for he exclaimed quickly: “Don’t stand there, love! Bring"
768,"the person in, if it be anyone particular.” Ere long, I heard the click"
768,"of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too"
768,"excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have"
768,surmised an awful calamity.
768,
768,"“Oh, Edgar, Edgar!” she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. “Oh,"
768,Edgar darling! Heathcliff’s come back—he is!” And she tightened her
768,embrace to a squeeze.
768,
768,"“Well, well,” cried her husband, crossly, “don’t strangle me for that!"
768,He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to
768,be frantic!”
768,
768,"“I know you didn’t like him,” she answered, repressing a little the"
768,"intensity of her delight. “Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now."
768,Shall I tell him to come up?”
768,
768,"“Here,” he said, “into the parlour?”"
768,
768,“Where else?” she asked.
768,
768,"He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for"
768,"him. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression—half angry, half"
768,laughing at his fastidiousness.
768,
768,"“No,” she added, after a while; “I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two"
768,"tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being"
768,"gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders."
768,"Will that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If"
768,"so, give directions. I’ll run down and secure my guest. I’m afraid the"
768,joy is too great to be real!”
768,
768,She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.
768,
768,"“_You_ bid him step up,” he said, addressing me; “and, Catherine, try"
768,"to be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness"
768,the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.”
768,
768,"I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently"
768,anticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without
768,"waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and"
768,"mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the"
768,lady’s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the
768,"door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton;"
768,and then she seized Linton’s reluctant fingers and crushed them into
768,"his. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed,"
768,"more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had"
768,"grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed"
768,quite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea
768,of his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in
768,expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton’s; it looked
768,"intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A"
768,half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full
768,"of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified:"
768,"quite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master’s"
768,surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss
768,"how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped"
768,"his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to"
768,speak.
768,
768,"“Sit down, sir,” he said, at length. “Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,"
768,"would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am"
768,gratified when anything occurs to please her.”
768,
768,"“And I also,” answered Heathcliff, “especially if it be anything in"
768,which I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.”
768,
768,"He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if"
768,she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his
768,to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed
768,"back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from"
768,hers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer
768,embarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a
768,"feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across"
768,"the rug, seized Heathcliff’s hands again, and laughed like one beside"
768,herself.
768,
768,“I shall think it a dream to-morrow!” she cried. “I shall not be able
768,"to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more."
768,"And yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don’t deserve this welcome. To be absent"
768,"and silent for three years, and never to think of me!”"
768,
768,"“A little more than you have thought of me,” he murmured. “I heard of"
768,"your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard"
768,"below, I meditated this plan—just to have one glimpse of your face, a"
768,"stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle"
768,my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on
768,myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of
768,"meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you’ll not drive me off"
768,"again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause."
768,I’ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and
768,"you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!”"
768,
768,"“Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the"
768,"table,” interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and"
768,"a due measure of politeness. “Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,"
768,wherever he may lodge to-night; and I’m thirsty.”
768,
768,"She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by"
768,"the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room."
768,The meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine’s cup was never filled:
768,"she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer,"
768,and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his
768,"stay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he"
768,went to Gimmerton?
768,
768,"“No, to Wuthering Heights,” he answered: “Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when"
768,I called this morning.”
768,
768,Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered
768,"this sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of"
768,"a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a"
768,cloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he
768,had better have remained away.
768,
768,"About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs."
768,"Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and"
768,pulling me by the hair to rouse me.
768,
768,"“I cannot rest, Ellen,” she said, by way of apology. “And I want some"
768,"living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky,"
768,because I’m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to
768,"open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he"
768,affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so
768,sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I
768,"gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for"
768,"a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.”"
768,
768,“What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?” I answered. “As lads they
768,"had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much"
768,"to hear him praised: it’s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him,"
768,unless you would like an open quarrel between them.”
768,
768,“But does it not show great weakness?” pursued she. “I’m not envious: I
768,never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella’s yellow hair and the
768,"whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the"
768,"family exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute"
768,"sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish"
768,"mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It"
768,"pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they"
768,"are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was"
768,"made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart"
768,chastisement might improve them all the same.”
768,
768,"“You’re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,” said I. “They humour you: I know what"
768,there would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge
768,their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
768,"desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal"
768,consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very
768,capable of being as obstinate as you.”
768,
768,"“And then we shall fight to the death, sha’n’t we, Nelly?” she"
768,"returned, laughing. “No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton’s"
768,"love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn’t wish to"
768,retaliate.”
768,
768,I advised her to value him the more for his affection.
768,
768,"“I do,” she answered, “but he needn’t resort to whining for trifles. It"
768,"is childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that"
768,"Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone’s regard, and it would honour the"
768,"first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said"
768,"it for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to"
768,"him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason"
768,"to object to him, I’m sure he behaved excellently!”"
768,
768,“What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?” I inquired. “He
768,"is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering"
768,the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!”
768,
768,"“He explained it,” she replied. “I wonder as much as you. He said he"
768,"called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you"
768,"resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to"
768,"questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;"
768,"and finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at"
768,"cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,"
768,"finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again"
768,in the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to
768,select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn’t trouble himself to
768,reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has
768,basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for
768,resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install
768,"himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an"
768,attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope
768,that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could
768,have if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for
768,permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother’s
768,covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy;
768,though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.”
768,
768,“It’s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!” said I.
768,"“Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?”"
768,
768,"“None for my friend,” she replied: “his strong head will keep him from"
768,danger; a little for Hindley: but he can’t be made morally worse than
768,he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this
768,evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry
768,"rebellion against Providence. Oh, I’ve endured very, very bitter"
768,"misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he’d be ashamed to"
768,cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which
768,induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently
768,"felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently"
768,"as I. However, it’s over, and I’ll take no revenge on his folly; I can"
768,afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive
768,"slap me on the cheek, I’d not only turn the other, but I’d ask pardon"
768,"for provoking it; and, as a proof, I’ll go make my peace with Edgar"
768,instantly. Good-night! I’m an angel!”
768,
768,In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her
768,fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only
768,abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by
768,"Catherine’s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to"
768,her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and
768,she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in
768,return as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and
768,servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.
768,
768,Heathcliff—Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future—used the liberty of
768,"visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed"
768,"estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also,"
768,deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in
768,receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.
768,He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was
768,remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of
768,"feeling. My master’s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further"
768,circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.
768,
768,His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of
768,Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards
768,the tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of
768,"eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen"
768,"feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved"
768,"her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside"
768,"the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible"
768,"fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such"
768,"a one’s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff’s disposition: to"
768,"know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable"
768,and unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank
768,forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He
768,would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment
768,"rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation"
768,of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the
768,blame on Heathcliff’s deliberate designing.
768,
768,"We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and"
768,pined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and
768,"teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her"
768,"limited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of"
768,"ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,"
768,"when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,"
768,complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the
768,"mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar"
768,neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left
768,"open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a"
768,"hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily"
768,"insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily,"
768,threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to
768,"exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only"
768,Catherine’s harshness which made her unhappy.
768,
768,"“How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?” cried the mistress,"
768,amazed at the unreasonable assertion. “You are surely losing your
768,"reason. When have I been harsh, tell me?”"
768,
768,"“Yesterday,” sobbed Isabella, “and now!”"
768,
768,“Yesterday!” said her sister-in-law. “On what occasion?”
768,
768,"“In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased,"
768,while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!”
768,
768,"“And that’s your notion of harshness?” said Catherine, laughing. “It"
768,was no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn’t care whether
768,you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff’s talk would have
768,nothing entertaining for your ears.”
768,
768,"“Oh, no,” wept the young lady; “you wished me away, because you knew I"
768,liked to be there!”
768,
768,"“Is she sane?” asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. “I’ll repeat our"
768,"conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it"
768,could have had for you.”
768,
768,"“I don’t mind the conversation,” she answered: “I wanted to be with—”"
768,
768,"“Well?” said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the"
768,sentence.
768,
768,"“With him: and I won’t be always sent off!” she continued, kindling up."
768,"“You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but"
768,yourself!”
768,
768,"“You are an impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in"
768,surprise. “But I’ll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you
768,can covet the admiration of Heathcliff—that you consider him an
768,"agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?”"
768,
768,"“No, you have not,” said the infatuated girl. “I love him more than"
768,"ever you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!”"
768,
768,"“I wouldn’t be you for a kingdom, then!” Catherine declared,"
768,"emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. “Nelly, help me to"
768,convince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an
768,"unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid"
768,wilderness of furze and whinstone. I’d as soon put that little canary
768,"into the park on a winter’s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart"
768,"on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing"
768,"else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don’t imagine that"
768,he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern
768,exterior! He’s not a rough diamond—a pearl-containing oyster of a
768,"rustic: he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, ‘Let"
768,"this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to"
768,"harm them;’ I say, ‘Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be"
768,"wronged:’ and he’d crush you like a sparrow’s egg, Isabella, if he"
768,found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn’t love a Linton; and
768,yet he’d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations:
768,avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There’s my picture: and
768,"I’m his friend—so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you,"
768,"I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his"
768,trap.”
768,
768,Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.
768,
768,"“For shame! for shame!” she repeated, angrily. “You are worse than"
768,"twenty foes, you poisonous friend!”"
768,
768,"“Ah! you won’t believe me, then?” said Catherine. “You think I speak"
768,from wicked selfishness?”
768,
768,"“I’m certain you do,” retorted Isabella; “and I shudder at you!”"
768,
768,"“Good!” cried the other. “Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I"
768,"have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.”—"
768,
768,"“And I must suffer for her egotism!” she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left"
768,"the room. “All, all is against me: she has blighted my single"
768,"consolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn’t she? Mr. Heathcliff is"
768,"not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he"
768,remember her?”
768,
768,"“Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,” I said. “He’s a bird of bad"
768,"omen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can’t"
768,"contradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any"
768,one besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.
768,Honest people don’t hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has
768,"he got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man"
768,whom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.
768,"They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been"
768,"borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I"
768,heard only a week ago—it was Joseph who told me—I met him at Gimmerton:
768,"‘Nelly,’ he said, ‘we’s hae a crowner’s ’quest enow, at ahr folks’. One"
768,on ’em ’s a’most getten his finger cut off wi’ hauding t’ other fro’
768,"stickin’ hisseln loike a cawlf. That’s maister, yah knaw, ’at ’s soa"
768,up o’ going tuh t’ grand ’sizes. He’s noan feared o’ t’ bench o’
768,"judges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on"
768,"’em, not he! He fair likes—he langs to set his brazened face agean ’em!"
768,"And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he’s a rare ’un. He can girn a"
768,laugh as well ’s onybody at a raight divil’s jest. Does he niver say
768,"nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t’ Grange? This is t’"
768,"way on ’t:—up at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und"
768,"can’le-light till next day at noon: then, t’ fooil gangs banning un"
768,"raving to his cham’er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i’ thur"
768,"lugs fur varry shame; un’ the knave, why he can caint his brass, un’"
768,"ate, un’ sleep, un’ off to his neighbour’s to gossip wi’ t’ wife. I’"
768,"course, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur’s goold runs into his"
768,"pocket, and her fathur’s son gallops down t’ broad road, while he flees"
768,"afore to oppen t’ pikes!’ Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal,"
768,"but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff’s conduct be true, you"
768,"would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?”"
768,
768,"“You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!” she replied. “I’ll not listen"
768,to your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me
768,that there is no happiness in the world!”
768,
768,"Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or"
768,"persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time"
768,"to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next"
768,"town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his"
768,"absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were"
768,"sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter"
768,"alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of"
768,"her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on"
768,"mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she"
768,"laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter"
768,to _her_. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was
768,"sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips."
768,"Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the"
768,"door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would"
768,gladly have done had it been practicable.
768,
768,"“Come in, that’s right!” exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair"
768,to the fire. “Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the
768,ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.
768,"Heathcliff, I’m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you"
768,"more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it’s not Nelly;"
768,don’t look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart
768,by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in
768,"your own power to be Edgar’s brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha’n’t run"
768,"off,” she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the"
768,"confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. “We were quarrelling like"
768,"cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of"
768,"devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would"
768,"but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself"
768,"to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever,"
768,and send my image into eternal oblivion!”
768,
768,"“Catherine!” said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to"
768,"struggle from the tight grasp that held her, “I’d thank you to adhere"
768,"to the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind"
768,enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and
768,I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me
768,beyond expression.”
768,
768,"As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly"
768,"indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned"
768,and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.
768,
768,“By no means!” cried Mrs. Linton in answer. “I won’t be named a dog in
768,"the manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don’t you"
768,evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love
768,Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I’m sure
768,"she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has"
768,"fasted ever since the day before yesterday’s walk, from sorrow and rage"
768,that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being
768,unacceptable.”
768,
768,"“I think you belie her,” said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face"
768,"them. “She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!”"
768,
768,"And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a"
768,"strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,"
768,which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it
768,raises. The poor thing couldn’t bear that; she grew white and red in
768,"rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength"
768,of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and
768,perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another
768,"closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to"
768,make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the
768,detainer’s with crescents of red.
768,
768,"“There’s a tigress!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and"
768,"shaking her hand with pain. “Begone, for God’s sake, and hide your"
768,vixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_. Can’t you
768,"fancy the conclusions he’ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are"
768,instruments that will do execution—you must beware of your eyes.”
768,
768,"“I’d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,” he"
768,"answered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. “But what did"
768,"you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not"
768,"speaking the truth, were you?”"
768,
768,"“I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been dying for your sake"
768,"several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a"
768,"deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,"
768,for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don’t notice it
768,"further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that’s all. I like her too"
768,"well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her"
768,up.”
768,
768,"“And I like her too ill to attempt it,” said he, “except in a very"
768,ghoulish fashion. You’d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that
768,"mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white"
768,"the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day"
768,or two: they detestably resemble Linton’s.”
768,
768,“Delectably!” observed Catherine. “They are dove’s eyes—angel’s!”
768,
768,"“She’s her brother’s heir, is she not?” he asked, after a brief"
768,silence.
768,
768,"“I should be sorry to think so,” returned his companion. “Half a dozen"
768,"nephews shall erase her title, please heaven! Abstract your mind from"
768,the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour’s
768,goods; remember _this_ neighbour’s goods are mine.”
768,
768,"“If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,” said"
768,"Heathcliff; “but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely"
768,"mad; and, in short, we’ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.”"
768,
768,"From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from"
768,"her thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the"
768,course of the evening. I saw him smile to himself—grin rather—and lapse
768,into ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from
768,the apartment.
768,
768,I determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the
768,"master’s, in preference to Catherine’s side: with reason I imagined,"
768,"for he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she—she could not be"
768,"called the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide"
768,"latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less"
768,sympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen which might
768,have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr.
768,"Heathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His"
768,"visits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master"
768,also. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I
768,felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked
768,"wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting"
768,his time to spring and destroy.

768,
768,CHAPTER XI
768,
768,
768,"Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I’ve got up in"
768,"a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the"
768,farm. I’ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how
768,people talked regarding his ways; and then I’ve recollected his
768,"confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched"
768,"from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken"
768,at my word.
768,
768,"One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to"
768,Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a
768,"bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I"
768,came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your
768,"left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north"
768,"side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a"
768,"guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone"
768,"yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why,"
768,but all at once a gush of child’s sensations flowed into my heart.
768,Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed
768,"long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole"
768,"near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were"
768,"fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as"
768,"reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the"
768,"withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand"
768,scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. “Poor Hindley!” I
768,"exclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a"
768,momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight
768,into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an
768,irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to
768,comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought—or
768,should die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to
768,the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I
768,trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood
768,looking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an
768,"elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the"
768,"bars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton,"
768,"not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since."
768,
768,"“God bless thee, darling!” I cried, forgetting instantaneously my"
768,"foolish fears. “Hareton, it’s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.”"
768,
768,"He retreated out of arm’s length, and picked up a large flint."
768,
768,"“I am come to see thy father, Hareton,” I added, guessing from the"
768,"action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not"
768,recognised as one with me.
768,
768,"He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but"
768,"could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,"
768,"from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses,"
768,"which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with"
768,"practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking"
768,expression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than
768,"angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it"
768,"to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as"
768,if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed
768,"another, keeping it out of his reach."
768,
768,"“Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?” I inquired. “The"
768,curate?”
768,
768,"“Damn the curate, and thee! Gie me that,” he replied."
768,
768,"“Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,” said I."
768,“Who’s your master?”
768,
768,"“Devil daddy,” was his answer."
768,
768,“And what do you learn from daddy?” I continued.
768,
768,He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. “What does he teach you?” I
768,asked.
768,
768,"“Naught,” said he, “but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me,"
768,because I swear at him.”
768,
768,“Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?” I observed.
768,
768,"“Ay—nay,” he drawled."
768,
768,"“Who, then?”"
768,
768,“Heathcliff.”
768,
768,“I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.”
768,
768,“Ay!” he answered again.
768,
768,"Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the"
768,sentences—“I known’t: he pays dad back what he gies to me—he curses
768,daddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.”
768,
768,"“And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?” I pursued."
768,
768,"“No, I was told the curate should have his —— teeth dashed down his ——"
768,"throat, if he stepped over the threshold—Heathcliff had promised that!”"
768,
768,"I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman"
768,"called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He"
768,"went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,"
768,Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran
768,"down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I"
768,"gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a"
768,goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella’s affair: except
768,"that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and"
768,doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the
768,"Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs."
768,Linton’s pleasure.
768,
768,The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some
768,pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law
768,"for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining,"
768,and we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of
768,"bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as"
768,"soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping"
768,"survey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I"
768,"drew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said"
768,"something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to"
768,"prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he"
768,apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was
768,"another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the"
768,scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.
768,
768,"“Judas! Traitor!” I ejaculated. “You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A"
768,deliberate deceiver.”
768,
768,"“Who is, Nelly?” said Catherine’s voice at my elbow: I had been"
768,over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.
768,
768,"“Your worthless friend!” I answered, warmly: “the sneaking rascal"
768,"yonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us—he is coming in! I wonder"
768,will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to
768,"Miss, when he told you he hated her?”"
768,
768,"Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden;"
768,"and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn’t withhold"
768,giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on
768,"silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to"
768,be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.
768,
768,"“To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!” she cried."
768,"“You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you"
768,"about, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!—I beg you"
768,"will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to"
768,draw the bolts against you!”
768,
768,“God forbid that he should try!” answered the black villain. I detested
768,him just then. “God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder
768,after sending him to heaven!”
768,
768,"“Hush!” said Catherine, shutting the inner door. “Don’t vex me. Why"
768,have you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?”
768,
768,"“What is it to you?” he growled. “I have a right to kiss her, if she"
768,chooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband:
768,_you_ needn’t be jealous of me!”
768,
768,"“I’m not jealous of you,” replied the mistress; “I’m jealous for you."
768,"Clear your face: you sha’n’t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you"
768,"shall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff!"
768,"There, you won’t answer. I’m certain you don’t.”"
768,
768,“And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?” I
768,inquired.
768,
768,"“Mr. Linton should approve,” returned my lady, decisively."
768,
768,"“He might spare himself the trouble,” said Heathcliff: “I could do as"
768,"well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind"
768,"to speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware"
768,that I _know_ you have treated me infernally—infernally! Do you hear?
768,"And if you flatter yourself that I don’t perceive it, you are a fool;"
768,"and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot:"
768,"and if you fancy I’ll suffer unrevenged, I’ll convince you of the"
768,"contrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me"
768,your sister-in-law’s secret: I swear I’ll make the most of it. And
768,stand you aside!”
768,
768,"“What new phase of his character is this?” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in"
768,amazement. “I’ve treated you infernally—and you’ll take your revenge!
768,"How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you"
768,infernally?”
768,
768,"“I seek no revenge on you,” replied Heathcliff, less vehemently."
768,“That’s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don’t
768,turn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to
768,"torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a"
768,"little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are"
768,"able. Having levelled my palace, don’t erect a hovel and complacently"
768,admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you
768,"really wished me to marry Isabel, I’d cut my throat!”"
768,
768,"“Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?” cried Catherine."
768,"“Well, I won’t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering"
768,"Satan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You"
768,prove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your
768,"coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us"
768,"at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if"
768,"you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you’ll hit on exactly"
768,the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.”
768,
768,"The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and"
768,gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could
768,"neither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms,"
768,brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek
768,"the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long."
768,
768,"“Ellen,” said he, when I entered, “have you seen your mistress?”"
768,
768,"“Yes; she’s in the kitchen, sir,” I answered. “She’s sadly put out by"
768,"Mr. Heathcliff’s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it’s time to"
768,"arrange his visits on another footing. There’s harm in being too soft,"
768,"and now it’s come to this—.” And I related the scene in the court, and,"
768,"as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could"
768,not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so
768,"afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had"
768,difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he
768,did not clear his wife of blame.
768,
768,“This is insufferable!” he exclaimed. “It is disgraceful that she
768,"should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two"
768,"men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue"
768,with the low ruffian—I have humoured her enough.”
768,
768,"He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,"
768,"followed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their"
768,"angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed"
768,"vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat"
768,"cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and"
768,"made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,"
768,"abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation."
768,
768,"“How is this?” said Linton, addressing her; “what notion of propriety"
768,"must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to"
768,"you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you"
768,"think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,"
768,imagine I can get used to it too!”
768,
768,"“Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?” asked the mistress, in a"
768,"tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both"
768,"carelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised"
768,"his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on"
768,"purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton’s attention to him. He"
768,succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high
768,flights of passion.
768,
768,"“I’ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,” he said quietly; “not that"
768,"I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you"
768,were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up
768,"your acquaintance, I acquiesced—foolishly. Your presence is a moral"
768,"poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to"
768,"prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into"
768,"this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure."
768,Three minutes’ delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.”
768,
768,Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye
768,full of derision.
768,
768,"“Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!” he said. “It is in"
768,"danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton,"
768,I’m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!”
768,
768,"My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men:"
768,he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the
768,"hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I"
768,"attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and"
768,locked it.
768,
768,"“Fair means!” she said, in answer to her husband’s look of angry"
768,"surprise. “If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or"
768,allow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more
768,"valour than you possess. No, I’ll swallow the key before you shall get"
768,it! I’m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant
768,"indulgence of one’s weak nature, and the other’s bad one, I earn for"
768,"thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I"
768,"was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick,"
768,for daring to think an evil thought of me!”
768,
768,It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the
768,"master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine’s grasp, and for"
768,safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr.
768,"Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew"
768,deadly pale. For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion:
768,mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on
768,"the back of a chair, and covered his face."
768,
768,"“Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!” exclaimed"
768,Mrs. Linton. “We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as
768,soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a
768,"colony of mice. Cheer up! you sha’n’t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb,"
768,it’s a sucking leveret.”
768,
768,"“I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!” said her friend. “I"
768,"compliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering"
768,"thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I’d"
768,"kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he"
768,"weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?”"
768,
768,The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.
768,"He’d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and"
768,struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a
768,"slighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr."
768,"Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to"
768,the front entrance.
768,
768,"“There! you’ve done with coming here,” cried Catherine. “Get away, now;"
768,he’ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he
768,"did overhear us, of course he’d never forgive you. You’ve played me an"
768,"ill turn, Heathcliff! But go—make haste! I’d rather see Edgar at bay"
768,than you.”
768,
768,“Do you suppose I’m going with that blow burning in my gullet?” he
768,"thundered. “By hell, no! I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut"
768,"before I cross the threshold! If I don’t floor him now, I shall murder"
768,"him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!”"
768,
768,"“He is not coming,” I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. “There’s the"
768,coachman and the two gardeners; you’ll surely not wait to be thrust
768,"into the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very"
768,"likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil"
768,his orders.”
768,
768,The gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them. They
768,"had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,"
768,resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the
768,"poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as"
768,they tramped in.
768,
768,"Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs."
768,"She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was"
768,anxious to keep her in ignorance.
768,
768,"“I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!” she exclaimed, throwing herself on the"
768,sofa. “A thousand smiths’ hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella
768,to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else
768,"aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to"
768,"Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I’m in danger of being"
768,seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed
768,"me shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin"
768,"a string of abuse or complainings; I’m certain I should recriminate,"
768,"and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You"
768,are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him
768,"to turn listener? Heathcliff’s talk was outrageous, after you left us;"
768,"but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant"
768,nothing. Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool’s craving to hear evil of
768,"self, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered"
768,"our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really,"
768,when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I
768,had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care
768,"hardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however"
768,"the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how"
768,"long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend—if Edgar will be"
768,"mean and jealous, I’ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own."
768,"That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to"
768,extremity! But it’s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I’d not
768,take Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in
768,dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that
768,"policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,"
768,on frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that
768,"countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.”"
768,
768,"The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,"
768,rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but
768,I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion
768,"to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control"
768,"herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish"
768,"to “frighten” her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for"
768,the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I
768,met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of
768,turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel
768,together. He began to speak first.
768,
768,"“Remain where you are, Catherine,” he said; without any anger in his"
768,"voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. “I shall not stay. I am"
768,neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn
768,"whether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue your"
768,intimacy with—”
768,
768,"“Oh, for mercy’s sake,” interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,"
768,"“for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood"
768,cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but
768,"mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.”"
768,
768,"“To get rid of me, answer my question,” persevered Mr. Linton. “You"
768,_must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found
768,"that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up"
768,"Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you"
768,to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely
768,_require_ to know which you choose.”
768,
768,"“I require to be let alone!” exclaimed Catherine, furiously. “I demand"
768,"it! Don’t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you—you leave me!”"
768,
768,She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It
768,"was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!"
768,"There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and"
768,"grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to"
768,splinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and
768,fear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I
768,"brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her"
768,"face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up"
768,"her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the"
768,aspect of death. Linton looked terrified.
768,
768,"“There is nothing in the world the matter,” I whispered. I did not want"
768,"him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart."
768,
768,"“She has blood on her lips!” he said, shuddering."
768,
768,"“Never mind!” I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,"
768,"previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously"
768,"gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up—her hair"
768,"flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck"
768,and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken
768,"bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then"
768,"rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her"
768,chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against
768,me.
768,
768,"As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to"
768,"ask whether she would have some carried up. “No!” she replied,"
768,peremptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and
768,"again on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on"
768,"his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning"
768,"his wife’s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour’s interview,"
768,during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper
768,horror for Heathcliff’s advances: but he could make nothing of her
768,"evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination"
768,"unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were"
768,"so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all"
768,bonds of relationship between herself and him.

768,
768,CHAPTER XII
768,
768,
768,"While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and"
768,almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books
768,"that he never opened—wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague"
768,"expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her"
768,"own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation—and _she_ fasted"
768,"pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was"
768,"ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running"
768,"to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,"
768,"convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and"
768,"that lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any"
768,expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the
768,"sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady’s name, since he might"
768,not hear her voice. I determined they should come about as they pleased
768,"for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice"
768,at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.
768,
768,"Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished"
768,"the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a"
768,"basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a"
768,"speech meant for Edgar’s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it"
768,to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. She ate and drank
768,"eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and"
768,"groaning. “Oh, I will die,” she exclaimed, “since no one cares anything"
768,about me. I wish I had not taken that.” Then a good while after I heard
768,"her murmur, “No, I’ll not die—he’d be glad—he does not love me at"
768,all—he would never miss me!”
768,
768,"“Did you want anything, ma’am?” I inquired, still preserving my"
768,"external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange,"
768,exaggerated manner.
768,
768,"“What is that apathetic being doing?” she demanded, pushing the thick"
768,"entangled locks from her wasted face. “Has he fallen into a lethargy,"
768,or is he dead?”
768,
768,"“Neither,” replied I; “if you mean Mr. Linton. He’s tolerably well, I"
768,"think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is"
768,"continually among his books, since he has no other society.”"
768,
768,"I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I"
768,could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.
768,
768,"“Among his books!” she cried, confounded. “And I dying! I on the brink"
768,"of the grave! My God! does he know how I’m altered?” continued she,"
768,staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite
768,"wall. “Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet—in play,"
768,"perhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if"
768,"it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I’ll choose"
768,between these two: either to starve at once—that would be no punishment
768,"unless he had a heart—or to recover, and leave the country. Are you"
768,speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly
768,indifferent for my life?”
768,
768,"“Why, ma’am,” I answered, “the master has no idea of your being"
768,deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die
768,of hunger.”
768,
768,“You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?” she returned. “Persuade
768,him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!”
768,
768,"“No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,” I suggested, “that you have eaten some"
768,"food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its"
768,good effects.”
768,
768,"“If I were only sure it would kill him,” she interrupted, “I’d kill"
768,myself directly! These three awful nights I’ve never closed my lids—and
768,"oh, I’ve been tormented! I’ve been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy"
768,"you don’t like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and"
768,"despised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all"
768,"turned to enemies in a few hours. _They_ have, I’m positive; the people"
768,"_here_. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!"
768,"Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be"
768,so dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to
768,see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace
768,"to his house, and going back to his _books_! What in the name of all"
768,"that feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?”"
768,
768,She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.
768,"Linton’s philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her"
768,"feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;"
768,"then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the"
768,"window. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the"
768,"north-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her"
768,"face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and"
768,"brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor’s"
768,injunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was
768,"violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey"
768,"her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from"
768,"the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to"
768,their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.
768,
768,"“That’s a turkey’s,” she murmured to herself; “and this is a wild"
768,"duck’s; and this is a pigeon’s. Ah, they put pigeons’ feathers in the"
768,pillows—no wonder I couldn’t die! Let me take care to throw it on the
768,floor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock’s; and this—I should
768,know it among a thousand—it’s a lapwing’s. Bonny bird; wheeling over
768,"our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for"
768,"the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This"
768,"feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its"
768,"nest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap"
768,"over it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he’d never"
768,"shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn’t. Yes, here are more! Did he"
768,"shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.”"
768,
768,"“Give over with that baby-work!” I interrupted, dragging the pillow"
768,"away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing"
768,its contents by handfuls. “Lie down and shut your eyes: you’re
768,wandering. There’s a mess! The down is flying about like snow.”
768,
768,I went here and there collecting it.
768,
768,"“I see in you, Nelly,” she continued dreamily, “an aged woman: you have"
768,grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under
768,"Penistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;"
768,"pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That’s"
768,what you’ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I’m
768,"not wandering: you’re mistaken, or else I should believe you really"
768,"_were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone"
768,"Crags; and I’m conscious it’s night, and there are two candles on the"
768,table making the black press shine like jet.”
768,
768,“The black press? where is that?” I asked. “You are talking in your
768,sleep!”
768,
768,"“It’s against the wall, as it always is,” she replied. “It _does_"
768,appear odd—I see a face in it!”
768,
768,"“There’s no press in the room, and never was,” said I, resuming my"
768,"seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her."
768,
768,"“Don’t _you_ see that face?” she inquired, gazing earnestly at the"
768,mirror.
768,
768,"And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be"
768,her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.
768,
768,"“It’s behind there still!” she pursued, anxiously. “And it stirred. Who"
768,"is it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the"
768,room is haunted! I’m afraid of being alone!”
768,
768,"I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of"
768,"shudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze"
768,towards the glass.
768,
768,"“There’s nobody here!” I insisted. “It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you"
768,knew it a while since.”
768,
768,"“Myself!” she gasped, “and the clock is striking twelve! It’s true,"
768,then! that’s dreadful!”
768,
768,"Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I"
768,attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her
768,husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek—the shawl had
768,dropped from the frame.
768,
768,"“Why, what _is_ the matter?” cried I. “Who is coward now? Wake up! That"
768,"is the glass—the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and"
768,there am I too by your side.”
768,
768,"Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually"
768,passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of
768,shame.
768,
768,"“Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,” she sighed. “I thought I was lying"
768,"in my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I’m weak, my brain got"
768,"confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don’t say anything; but stay"
768,with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.”
768,
768,"“A sound sleep would do you good, ma’am,” I answered: “and I hope this"
768,suffering will prevent your trying starving again.”
768,
768,"“Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!” she went on"
768,"bitterly, wringing her hands. “And that wind sounding in the firs by"
768,the lattice. Do let me feel it—it comes straight down the moor—do let
768,me have one breath!”
768,
768,To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast
768,"rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still"
768,"now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued"
768,her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.
768,
768,"“How long is it since I shut myself in here?” she asked, suddenly"
768,reviving.
768,
768,"“It was Monday evening,” I replied, “and this is Thursday night, or"
768,"rather Friday morning, at present.”"
768,
768,“What! of the same week?” she exclaimed. “Only that brief time?”
768,
768,"“Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,”"
768,observed I.
768,
768,"“Well, it seems a weary number of hours,” she muttered doubtfully: “it"
768,must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had
768,"quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this"
768,"room desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness"
768,"overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn’t explain to Edgar"
768,"how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he"
768,"persisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he"
768,"did not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to"
768,escape from him and his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see
768,"and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I’ll tell you what I"
768,"thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my"
768,"reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg,"
768,"and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was"
768,enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some
768,"great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and"
768,"worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the"
768,whole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that
768,"they had been at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my"
768,misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me
768,"and Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from"
768,"a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the"
768,"panels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and"
768,then memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of
768,despair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been
768,"temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at"
768,"twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early"
768,"association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and"
768,"been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross"
768,"Grange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth,"
768,from what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where
768,"I grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to"
768,"unsettle me! You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and"
768,"compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I’m burning! I wish I were out of"
768,"doors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and"
768,"laughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed?"
768,why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I’m sure I
768,should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the
768,"window again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don’t you move?”"
768,
768,"“Because I won’t give you your death of cold,” I answered."
768,
768,"“You won’t give me a chance of life, you mean,” she said sullenly."
768,"“However, I’m not helpless yet; I’ll open it myself.”"
768,
768,"And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the"
768,"room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless"
768,of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I
768,"entreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon"
768,"found her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious,"
768,I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no
768,"moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed"
768,"from any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and"
768,those at Wuthering Heights were never visible—still she asserted she
768,caught their shining.
768,
768,"“Look!” she cried eagerly, “that’s my room with the candle in it, and"
768,the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph’s
768,"garret. Joseph sits up late, doesn’t he? He’s waiting till I come home"
768,"that he may lock the gate. Well, he’ll wait a while yet. It’s a rough"
768,"journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton"
768,"Kirk to go that journey! We’ve braved its ghosts often together, and"
768,"dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But,"
768,"Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I’ll keep"
768,"you. I’ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep,"
768,"and throw the church down over me, but I won’t rest till you are with"
768,me. I never will!”
768,
768,"She paused, and resumed with a strange smile. “He’s considering—he’d"
768,"rather I’d come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard."
768,"You are slow! Be content, you always followed me!”"
768,
768,"Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I"
768,"could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of"
768,"herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when,"
768,"to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr."
768,"Linton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing"
768,"through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by"
768,"curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour."
768,
768,"“Oh, sir!” I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the"
768,"sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. “My poor"
768,"mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;"
768,"pray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she’s"
768,hard to guide any way but her own.”
768,
768,"“Catherine ill?” he said, hastening to us. “Shut the window, Ellen!"
768,Catherine! why—”
768,
768,He was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton’s appearance smote him
768,"speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified"
768,astonishment.
768,
768,"“She’s been fretting here,” I continued, “and eating scarcely anything,"
768,"and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening,"
768,"and so we couldn’t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it"
768,ourselves; but it is nothing.”
768,
768,I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. “It is
768,"nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?” he said sternly. “You shall account more"
768,clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!” And he took his wife in his
768,"arms, and looked at her with anguish."
768,
768,At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her
768,"abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her"
768,"eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her"
768,"attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her."
768,
768,"“Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?” she said, with angry"
768,animation. “You are one of those things that are ever found when least
768,"wanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty"
768,of lamentations now—I see we shall—but they can’t keep me from my
768,"narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I’m bound before spring"
768,"is over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the"
768,"chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please"
768,yourself whether you go to them or come to me!”
768,
768,"“Catherine, what have you done?” commenced the master. “Am I nothing to"
768,you any more? Do you love that wretch Heath—”
768,
768,"“Hush!” cried Mrs. Linton. “Hush, this moment! You mention that name"
768,and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you
768,touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top
768,"before you lay hands on me again. I don’t want you, Edgar: I’m past"
768,"wanting you. Return to your books. I’m glad you possess a consolation,"
768,for all you had in me is gone.”
768,
768,"“Her mind wanders, sir,” I interposed. “She has been talking nonsense"
768,"the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and"
768,"she’ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.”"
768,
768,"“I desire no further advice from you,” answered Mr. Linton. “You knew"
768,"your mistress’s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to"
768,give me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was
768,heartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!”
768,
768,"I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for"
768,another’s wicked waywardness. “I knew Mrs. Linton’s nature to be
768,"headstrong and domineering,” cried I: “but I didn’t know that you"
768,"wished to foster her fierce temper! I didn’t know that, to humour her,"
768,I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful
768,"servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant’s wages!"
768,"Well, it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may"
768,gather intelligence for yourself!”
768,
768,"“The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen"
768,"Dean,” he replied."
768,
768,"“You’d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?” said"
768,"I. “Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to"
768,"drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison"
768,the mistress against you?”
768,
768,"Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our"
768,conversation.
768,
768,"“Ah! Nelly has played traitor,” she exclaimed, passionately. “Nelly is"
768,my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me
768,"go, and I’ll make her rue! I’ll make her howl a recantation!”"
768,
768,A maniac’s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to
768,disengage herself from Linton’s arms. I felt no inclination to tarry
768,"the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility,"
768,I quitted the chamber.
768,
768,"In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook"
768,"is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,"
768,"evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I"
768,"stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction"
768,impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.
768,"My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more"
768,"than vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a"
768,"handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the"
768,"animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its"
768,mistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could
768,"have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so."
768,"While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I"
768,repeatedly caught the beat of horses’ feet galloping at some distance;
768,but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I
768,"hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound,"
768,"in that place, at two o’clock in the morning."
768,
768,Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a
768,patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of
768,Catherine Linton’s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.
768,He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of
768,her surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to
768,his directions than she had shown herself before.
768,
768,"“Nelly Dean,” said he, “I can’t help fancying there’s an extra cause"
768,for this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We’ve odd reports up
768,"here. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a"
768,trifle; and that sort of people should not either. It’s hard work
768,"bringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?”"
768,
768,"“The master will inform you,” I answered; “but you are acquainted with"
768,"the Earnshaws’ violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I"
768,may say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a
768,"tempest of passion with a kind of fit. That’s her account, at least:"
768,"for she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up."
768,"Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and"
768,"remains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind"
768,filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.”
768,
768,"“Mr. Linton will be sorry?” observed Kenneth, interrogatively."
768,
768,“Sorry? he’ll break his heart should anything happen!” I replied.
768,“Don’t alarm him more than necessary.”
768,
768,"“Well, I told him to beware,” said my companion; “and he must bide the"
768,consequences of neglecting my warning! Hasn’t he been intimate with Mr.
768,Heathcliff lately?”
768,
768,"“Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,” answered I, “though more"
768,"on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than"
768,because the master likes his company. At present he’s discharged from
768,the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after
768,Miss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he’ll be taken in
768,again.”
768,
768,“And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?” was the doctor’s
768,next question.
768,
768,"“I’m not in her confidence,” returned I, reluctant to continue the"
768,subject.
768,
768,"“No, she’s a sly one,” he remarked, shaking his head. “She keeps her"
768,own counsel! But she’s a real little fool. I have it from good
768,authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and
768,Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house
768,"above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount"
768,his horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him
768,off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first
768,meeting after that: when it was to be he didn’t hear; but you urge Mr.
768,Linton to look sharp!”
768,
768,"This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran"
768,most of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I
768,"spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the"
768,"house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have"
768,"escaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On"
768,"ascending to Isabella’s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was"
768,empty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton’s illness might have
768,arrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare
768,possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not
768,"pursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the"
768,"place with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,"
768,"absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to"
768,"spare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue,"
768,"and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I"
768,went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay
768,in a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess
768,"of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every"
768,change of her painfully expressive features.
768,
768,"The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him"
768,"of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve"
768,"around her perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he signified the"
768,"threatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of"
768,intellect.
768,
768,"I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we"
768,never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual
768,"hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging"
768,whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one
768,was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she
768,"slept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient"
768,"for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her"
768,sister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was
768,spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of
768,"the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to"
768,"Gimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the"
768,"chamber, crying: “Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master,"
768,"master, our young lady—”"
768,
768,"“Hold your noise!” cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner."
768,
768,"“Speak lower, Mary—What is the matter?” said Mr. Linton. “What ails"
768,your young lady?”
768,
768,"“She’s gone, she’s gone! Yon’ Heathcliff’s run off wi’ her!” gasped the"
768,girl.
768,
768,"“That is not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. “It cannot"
768,"be: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It"
768,is incredible: it cannot be.”
768,
768,"As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his"
768,demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.
768,
768,"“Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,” she stammered,"
768,“and he asked whether we weren’t in trouble at the Grange. I thought he
768,"meant for missis’s sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, ‘There’s"
768,"somebody gone after ’em, I guess?’ I stared. He saw I knew nought about"
768,"it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse’s"
768,"shoe fastened at a blacksmith’s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not"
768,very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith’s lass had got up to
768,spy who they were: she knew them both directly. And she noticed the
768,"man—Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob’dy could mistake him,"
768,besides—put a sovereign in her father’s hand for payment. The lady had
768,"a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she"
768,"drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both"
768,"bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and"
768,went as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing
768,"to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.”"
768,
768,"I ran and peeped, for form’s sake, into Isabella’s room; confirming,"
768,"when I returned, the servant’s statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his"
768,"seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the"
768,"meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order,"
768,or uttering a word.
768,
768,"“Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,” I"
768,inquired. “How should we do?”
768,
768,"“She went of her own accord,” answered the master; “she had a right to"
768,go if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only
768,"my sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has"
768,disowned me.”
768,
768,And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry
768,"further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what"
768,"property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when"
768,I knew it.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XIII
768,
768,
768,"For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs."
768,Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was
768,denominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child
768,"more devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching,"
768,and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a
768,"shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he"
768,saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the
768,"source of constant future anxiety—in fact, that his health and strength"
768,were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity—he knew no
768,limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine’s life was declared out of
768,"danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the"
768,"gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes"
768,with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance
768,"also, and she would soon be entirely her former self."
768,
768,The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the
768,"following March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a"
768,"handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of"
768,"pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered"
768,them eagerly together.
768,
768,"“These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,” she exclaimed. “They"
768,"remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted"
768,"snow. Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost"
768,gone?”
768,
768,"“The snow is quite gone down here, darling,” replied her husband; “and"
768,I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is
768,"blue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim"
768,"full. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you"
768,"under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the"
768,"air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.”"
768,
768,"“I shall never be there but once more,” said the invalid; “and then"
768,"you’ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you’ll long"
768,"again to have me under this roof, and you’ll look back and think you"
768,were happy to-day.”
768,
768,"Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by"
768,"the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the"
768,tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We
768,"knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long"
768,"confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it"
768,might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to
768,"light a fire in the many-weeks’ deserted parlour, and to set an"
768,"easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down,"
768,"and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected,"
768,"revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free"
768,from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By
768,evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade
768,"her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa"
768,"for her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the"
768,"fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where"
768,you lie at present—on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon
768,"strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar’s arm."
768,"Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was. And"
768,"there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that"
768,of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton’s
768,"heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger’s"
768,"gripe, by the birth of an heir."
768,
768,"I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from"
768,"her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff."
768,It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil
768,"an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and"
768,"reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she"
768,"could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal"
768,"it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more,"
768,"I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a"
768,bride just out of the honeymoon. I’ll read it: for I keep it yet. Any
768,"relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living."
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"DEAR ELLEN, it begins,—I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and"
768,"heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very"
768,"ill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too"
768,"angry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write"
768,"to somebody, and the only choice left me is you."
768,
768,Inform Edgar that I’d give the world to see his face again—that my
768,heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left
768,"it, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and"
768,Catherine! _I can’t follow it though_—(these words are underlined)—they
768,"need not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please;"
768,"taking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or"
768,deficient affection.
768,
768,The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you
768,"two questions: the first is,—How did you contrive to preserve the"
768,common sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot
768,recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.
768,
768,The second question I have great interest in; it is this—Is Mr.
768,"Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I"
768,sha’n’t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to
768,"explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see"
768,"me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don’t write, but come, and"
768,bring me something from Edgar.
768,
768,"Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am"
768,led to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell
768,on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my
768,"thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and"
768,"dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries,"
768,and the rest was an unnatural dream!
768,
768,"The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I"
768,"judged it to be six o’clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to"
768,"inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as"
768,well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard
768,"of the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to"
768,receive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that
768,redounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a
768,"level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn"
768,"away. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;"
768,"reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived"
768,in an ancient castle.
768,
768,"Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen—a dingy,"
768,"untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it"
768,"was in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb"
768,"and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his"
768,mouth.
768,
768,"“This is Edgar’s legal nephew,” I reflected—“mine in a manner; I must"
768,"shake hands, and—yes—I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good"
768,understanding at the beginning.”
768,
768,"I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said—“How do you"
768,"do, my dear?”"
768,
768,He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.
768,
768,"“Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?” was my next essay at"
768,conversation.
768,
768,"An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not “frame off”"
768,rewarded my perseverance.
768,
768,"“Hey, Throttler, lad!” whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred"
768,"bull-dog from its lair in a corner. “Now, wilt thou be ganging?” he"
768,asked authoritatively.
768,
768,Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to
768,wait till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible;
768,"and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany"
768,"me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and"
768,replied—“Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?
768,Mincing un’ munching! How can I tell whet ye say?”
768,
768,"“I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!” I cried, thinking"
768,"him deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness."
768,
768,"“None o’ me! I getten summut else to do,” he answered, and continued"
768,"his work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and"
768,"countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I’m"
768,"sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt."
768,
768,"I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at"
768,"which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant"
768,"might show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall,"
768,"gaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his"
768,features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders;
768,"and _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine’s with all their"
768,beauty annihilated.
768,
768,"“What’s your business here?” he demanded, grimly. “Who are you?”"
768,
768,"“My name _was_ Isabella Linton,” I replied. “You’ve seen me before,"
768,"sir. I’m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here—I"
768,suppose by your permission.”
768,
768,"“Is he come back, then?” asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf."
768,
768,"“Yes—we came just now,” I said; “but he left me by the kitchen door;"
768,"and when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the"
768,"place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.”"
768,
768,“It’s well the hellish villain has kept his word!” growled my future
768,"host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering"
768,"Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and"
768,threats of what he would have done had the “fiend” deceived him.
768,
768,"I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined"
768,"to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that"
768,"intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There"
768,"was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment,"
768,whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant
768,"pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook"
768,"of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether"
768,"I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw"
768,"vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his"
768,"pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction"
768,"was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I"
768,shrank from disturbing him again.
768,
768,"You’ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,"
768,"seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and"
768,"remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing"
768,the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the
768,"Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass"
768,them! I questioned with myself—where must I turn for comfort? and—mind
768,"you don’t tell Edgar, or Catherine—above every sorrow beside, this rose"
768,pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally
768,"against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost"
768,"gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone"
768,"with him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not"
768,fear their intermeddling.
768,
768,"I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and"
768,"still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and"
768,"perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself"
768,"out at intervals. I listened to detect a woman’s voice in the house,"
768,"and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,"
768,"which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I"
768,"was not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in"
768,"his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise."
768,"Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed—“I’m tired"
768,"with my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant?"
768,"Direct me to her, as she won’t come to me!”"
768,
768,"“We have none,” he answered; “you must wait on yourself!”"
768,
768,"“Where must I sleep, then?” I sobbed; I was beyond regarding"
768,"self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness."
768,
768,"“Joseph will show you Heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that"
768,door—he’s in there.”
768,
768,"I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the"
768,"strangest tone—“Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your"
768,bolt—don’t omit it!”
768,
768,"“Well!” I said. “But why, Mr. Earnshaw?” I did not relish the notion of"
768,deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.
768,
768,"“Look here!” he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a"
768,"curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife"
768,"attached to the barrel. “That’s a great tempter to a desperate man, is"
768,"it not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his"
768,"door. If once I find it open he’s done for; I do it invariably, even"
768,though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that
768,should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own
768,schemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long
768,"as you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall"
768,save him!”
768,
768,I surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how
768,powerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his
768,"hand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my"
768,"face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was"
768,"covetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,"
768,and returned it to its concealment.
768,
768,"“I don’t care if you tell him,” said he. “Put him on his guard, and"
768,"watch for him. You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not"
768,shock you.”
768,
768,“What has Heathcliff done to you?” I asked. “In what has he wronged
768,"you, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn’t it be wiser to bid him"
768,quit the house?”
768,
768,"“No!” thundered Earnshaw; “should he offer to leave me, he’s a dead"
768,"man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose"
768,"_all_, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh,"
768,damnation! I _will_ have it back; and I’ll have _his_ gold too; and
768,then his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times
768,blacker with that guest than ever it was before!”
768,
768,"You’ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master’s habits. He is"
768,clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I
768,"shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant’s ill-bred"
768,moroseness as comparatively agreeable. He now recommenced his moody
768,"walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was"
768,"bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it;"
768,and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents
768,"of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the"
768,"bowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper,"
768,"and, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out"
768,"sharply, “_I’ll_ make the porridge!” I removed the vessel out of his"
768,"reach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. “Mr."
768,"Earnshaw,” I continued, “directs me to wait on myself: I will. I’m not"
768,"going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.”"
768,
768,"“Gooid Lord!” he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed"
768,stockings from the knee to the ankle. “If there’s to be fresh
768,"ortherings—just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev’ a"
768,"_mistress_ set o’er my heead, it’s like time to be flitting. I niver"
768,_did_ think to see t’ day that I mud lave th’ owld place—but I doubt
768,it’s nigh at hand!”
768,
768,"This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work,"
768,sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but
768,compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall
768,past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its
768,"apparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the"
768,handfuls of meal fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery
768,with growing indignation.
768,
768,"“Thear!” he ejaculated. “Hareton, thou willn’t sup thy porridge"
768,"to-neeght; they’ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear,"
768,"agean! I’d fling in bowl un’ all, if I wer ye! There, pale t’ guilp"
768,"off, un’ then ye’ll hae done wi’t. Bang, bang. It’s a mercy t’ bothom"
768,isn’t deaved out!”
768,
768,"It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four"
768,"had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from"
768,"the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling"
768,"from the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have"
768,his in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so
768,dirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety;
768,"assuring me, repeatedly, that “the barn was every bit as good” as I,"
768,"“and every bit as wollsome,” and wondering how I could fashion to be so"
768,"conceited. Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and"
768,"glowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug."
768,
768,"“I shall have my supper in another room,” I said. “Have you no place"
768,you call a parlour?”
768,
768,"“_Parlour_!” he echoed, sneeringly, “_parlour_! Nay, we’ve noa"
768,"_parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there’s maister’s; un’ if"
768,"yah dunnut loike maister, there’s us.”"
768,
768,"“Then I shall go upstairs,” I answered; “show me a chamber.”"
768,
768,"I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With"
768,"great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we"
768,"mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into"
768,the apartments we passed.
768,
768,"“Here’s a rahm,” he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on"
768,hinges. “It’s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There’s a pack o’
768,"corn i’ t’ corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye’re feared o’ muckying"
768,"yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o’ t’ top on’t.”"
768,
768,The “rahm” was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;
768,"various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare"
768,space in the middle.
768,
768,"“Why, man,” I exclaimed, facing him angrily, “this is not a place to"
768,sleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.”
768,
768,"“_Bed-rume_!” he repeated, in a tone of mockery. “Yah’s see all t’"
768,_bed-rumes_ thear is—yon’s mine.”
768,
768,"He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in"
768,"being more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless"
768,"bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end."
768,
768,“What do I want with yours?” I retorted. “I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does
768,"not lodge at the top of the house, does he?”"
768,
768,"“Oh! it’s Maister _Hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, as if making"
768,"a new discovery. “Couldn’t ye ha’ said soa, at onst? un’ then, I mud"
768,"ha’ telled ye, baht all this wark, that that’s just one ye cannut"
768,"see—he allas keeps it locked, un’ nob’dy iver mells on’t but hisseln.”"
768,
768,"“You’ve a nice house, Joseph,” I could not refrain from observing, “and"
768,pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the
768,madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my
768,"fate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose—there are"
768,"other rooms. For heaven’s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!”"
768,
768,He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the
768,"wooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt"
768,"and the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best"
768,"one. There was a carpet—a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by"
768,"dust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome"
768,oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material
768,and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the
768,"vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod"
768,"supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to"
768,"trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them"
768,severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was
768,"endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,"
768,"when my fool of a guide announced,—“This here is t’ maister’s.” My"
768,"supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience"
768,exhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of
768,"refuge, and means of repose."
768,
768,“Whear the divil?” began the religious elder. “The Lord bless us! The
768,"Lord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome"
768,nowt! Ye’ve seen all but Hareton’s bit of a cham’er. There’s not
768,another hoile to lig down in i’ th’ hahse!”
768,
768,"I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and"
768,"then seated myself at the stairs’-head, hid my face in my hands, and"
768,cried.
768,
768,"“Ech! ech!” exclaimed Joseph. “Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss"
768,"Cathy! Howsiver, t’ maister sall just tum’le o’er them brocken pots;"
768,un’ then we’s hear summut; we’s hear how it’s to be. Gooid-for-naught
768,"madling! ye desarve pining fro’ this to Churstmas, flinging t’ precious"
768,gifts uh God under fooit i’ yer flaysome rages! But I’m mista’en if ye
768,"shew yer sperrit lang. Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?"
768,I nobbut wish he may catch ye i’ that plisky. I nobbut wish he may.”
768,
768,"And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with"
768,him; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding
768,this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my
768,"pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its"
768,effects. An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of
768,"Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had"
768,"spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr."
768,Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of
768,"salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from"
768,"step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the"
768,spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our
768,labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw’s tread in the
768,"passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I"
768,stole into the nearest doorway. The dog’s endeavour to avoid him was
768,"unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged,"
768,"piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber,"
768,"and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put"
768,"him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton’s room, and the old man, on"
768,"seeing me, said,—“They’s rahm for boath ye un’ yer pride, now, I sud"
768,"think i’ the hahse. It’s empty; ye may hev’ it all to yerseln, un’ Him"
768,"as allas maks a third, i’ sich ill company!”"
768,
768,Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung
768,"myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was"
768,"deep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he"
768,"had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing"
768,there? I told him the cause of my staying up so late—that he had the
768,key of our room in his pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.
768,"He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he’d—but I’ll not"
768,"repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious"
768,and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at
768,"him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger"
768,or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which
768,"he wakens. He told me of Catherine’s illness, and accused my brother of"
768,"causing it; promising that I should be Edgar’s proxy in suffering, till"
768,he could get hold of him.
768,
768,I do hate him—I am wretched—I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one
768,breath of this to any one at the Grange. I shall expect you every
768,day—don’t disappoint me!—ISABELLA.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XIV
768,
768,
768,"As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and"
768,"informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a"
768,"letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton’s situation, and her"
768,"ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as"
768,"early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me."
768,
768,"“Forgiveness!” said Linton. “I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You"
768,"may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that"
768,"I am not _angry_, but I’m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can"
768,never think she’ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see
768,"her, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to"
768,"oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the"
768,country.”
768,
768,"“And you won’t write her a little note, sir?” I asked, imploringly."
768,
768,"“No,” he answered. “It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff’s"
768,family shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!”
768,
768,Mr. Edgar’s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the
768,"Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,"
768,when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines
768,to console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since
768,morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden
768,"causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being"
768,"observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,"
768,"dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,"
768,"that if I had been in the young lady’s place, I would, at least, have"
768,"swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already"
768,partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her
768,pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging
768,"lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she"
768,had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.
768,"Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his"
768,"pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite"
768,"friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that"
768,seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had
768,"circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have"
768,struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a
768,"thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and"
768,held out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She
768,"wouldn’t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I"
768,"went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her"
768,directly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her
768,"manœuvres, and said—“If you have got anything for Isabella (as no"
768,"doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her. You needn’t make a secret of"
768,it: we have no secrets between us.”
768,
768,"“Oh, I have nothing,” I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at"
768,once. “My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either
768,"a letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma’am, and"
768,"his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have"
768,occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the
768,"household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of"
768,keeping it up.”
768,
768,"Mrs. Heathcliff’s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat"
768,"in the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me,"
768,and began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as
768,"I thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by"
768,"cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I"
768,"blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended"
768,by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton’s example and avoid future
768,"interference with his family, for good or evil."
768,
768,"“Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,” I said; “she’ll never be like she"
768,"was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,"
768,"you’ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you’ll move out of this"
768,"country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I’ll inform you"
768,Catherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine
768,"Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is"
768,"changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is"
768,"compelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his"
768,"affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common"
768,"humanity, and a sense of duty!”"
768,
768,"“That is quite possible,” remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem"
768,calm: “quite possible that your master should have nothing but common
768,humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that
768,I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you
768,compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this
768,"house, I must exact a promise from you that you’ll get me an interview"
768,"with her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her! What do you say?”"
768,
768,"“I say, Mr. Heathcliff,” I replied, “you must not: you never shall,"
768,through my means. Another encounter between you and the master would
768,kill her altogether.”
768,
768,"“With your aid that may be avoided,” he continued; “and should there be"
768,danger of such an event—should he be the cause of adding a single
768,"trouble more to her existence—why, I think I shall be justified in"
768,going to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether
768,Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would
768,restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings:
768,"had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred"
768,"that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against"
768,"him. You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have"
768,banished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment
768,"her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his"
768,"blood! But, till then—if you don’t believe me, you don’t know me—till"
768,"then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his"
768,head!”
768,
768,"“And yet,” I interrupted, “you have no scruples in completely ruining"
768,"all hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her"
768,"remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her"
768,in a new tumult of discord and distress.”
768,
768,"“You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?” he said. “Oh, Nelly! you"
768,"know she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she"
768,spends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable
768,"period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my"
768,return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance
768,"could make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be"
768,"nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words"
768,"would comprehend my future—_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing"
768,"her, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she"
768,valued Edgar Linton’s attachment more than mine. If he loved with all
768,"the powers of his puny being, he couldn’t love as much in eighty years"
768,as I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the
768,sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole
768,affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer
768,"to her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like"
768,me: how can she love in him what he has not?”
768,
768,“Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can
768,"be,” cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. “No one has a right to talk"
768,"in that manner, and I won’t hear my brother depreciated in silence!”"
768,
768,"“Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn’t he?” observed"
768,"Heathcliff, scornfully. “He turns you adrift on the world with"
768,surprising alacrity.”
768,
768,"“He is not aware of what I suffer,” she replied. “I didn’t tell him"
768,that.”
768,
768,"“You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have"
768,you?”
768,
768,"“To say that I was married, I did write—you saw the note.”"
768,
768,“And nothing since?”
768,
768,“No.”
768,
768,"“My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,”"
768,"I remarked. “Somebody’s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose,"
768,"I may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn’t say.”"
768,
768,"“I should guess it was her own,” said Heathcliff. “She degenerates into"
768,a mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.
768,"You’d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was"
768,"weeping to go home. However, she’ll suit this house so much the better"
768,"for not being over nice, and I’ll take care she does not disgrace me by"
768,rambling abroad.”
768,
768,"“Well, sir,” returned I, “I hope you’ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff"
768,is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been
768,"brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve."
768,"You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you"
768,"must treat her kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot"
768,"doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn’t"
768,"have abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former"
768,"home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.”"
768,
768,"“She abandoned them under a delusion,” he answered; “picturing in me a"
768,"hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous"
768,"devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,"
768,so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my
768,"character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at"
768,"last, I think she begins to know me: I don’t perceive the silly smiles"
768,and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability
768,of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her
768,infatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to
768,"discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons"
768,could teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she
768,"announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually"
768,"succeeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I"
768,"assure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I"
768,"trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you"
768,"alone for half a day, won’t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?"
768,I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it
768,wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don’t care who knows
768,that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie
768,about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful
768,"softness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange,"
768,"was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first"
768,words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being
768,"belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for"
768,herself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate
768,"admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!"
768,"Now, was it not the depth of absurdity—of genuine idiocy, for that"
768,"pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?"
768,"Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an"
768,abject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I’ve
768,"sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on"
768,"what she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But"
768,"tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease:"
768,"that I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up"
768,"to this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation;"
768,"and, what’s more, she’d thank nobody for dividing us. If she desired to"
768,"go, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification"
768,to be derived from tormenting her!”
768,
768,"“Mr. Heathcliff,” said I, “this is the talk of a madman; your wife,"
768,"most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has"
768,"borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she’ll"
768,"doubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched,"
768,"ma’am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?”"
768,
768,"“Take care, Ellen!” answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully;"
768,there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her
768,partner’s endeavours to make himself detested. “Don’t put faith in a
768,"single word he speaks. He’s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human"
768,being! I’ve been told I might leave him before; and I’ve made the
768,"attempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you’ll not"
768,mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or
768,"Catherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to"
768,desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over
768,"him; and he sha’n’t obtain it—I’ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that"
768,he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure
768,"I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!”"
768,
768,“There—that will do for the present!” said Heathcliff. “If you are
768,"called upon in a court of law, you’ll remember her language, Nelly! And"
768,take a good look at that countenance: she’s near the point which would
768,"suit me. No; you’re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and"
768,"I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however"
768,distasteful the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say
768,"to Ellen Dean in private. That’s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!"
768,"Why, this is the road upstairs, child!”"
768,
768,"He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering—“I have"
768,"no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to"
768,crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with
768,greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.”
768,
768,"“Do you understand what the word pity means?” I said, hastening to"
768,resume my bonnet. “Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?”
768,
768,"“Put that down!” he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart."
768,"“You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or"
768,"compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine,"
768,and that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don’t desire
768,"to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only"
768,"wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to"
768,ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last night I
768,"was in the Grange garden six hours, and I’ll return there to-night; and"
768,"every night I’ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an"
768,"opportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate"
768,"to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I"
768,"stay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these"
768,pistols. But wouldn’t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with
768,"them, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I’d warn you when"
768,"I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was"
768,"alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would"
768,be hindering mischief.”
768,
768,I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer’s
768,"house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his"
768,destroying Mrs. Linton’s tranquillity for his satisfaction. “The
768,"commonest occurrence startles her painfully,” I said. “She’s all"
768,"nerves, and she couldn’t bear the surprise, I’m positive. Don’t"
768,"persist, sir! or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your"
768,designs; and he’ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates
768,from any such unwarrantable intrusions!”
768,
768,"“In that case I’ll take measures to secure you, woman!” exclaimed"
768,Heathcliff; “you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow
768,morning. It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear
768,"to see me; and as to surprising her, I don’t desire it: you must"
768,"prepare her—ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name,"
768,and that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if
768,I am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for
768,"her husband. Oh, I’ve no doubt she’s in hell among you! I guess by her"
768,"silence, as much as anything, what she feels. You say she is often"
768,"restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity? You"
768,talk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it be otherwise
768,"in her frightful isolation? And that insipid, paltry creature attending"
768,her from _duty_ and _humanity_! From _pity_ and _charity_! He might as
768,"well plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine"
768,he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares! Let us
768,"settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to"
768,"Catherine over Linton and his footman? Or will you be my friend, as you"
768,"have been hitherto, and do what I request? Decide! because there is no"
768,"reason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn"
768,ill-nature!”
768,
768,"Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him"
768,fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement. I
768,engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she
768,"consent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton’s next"
768,"absence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I"
768,"wouldn’t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the"
768,"way. Was it right or wrong? I fear it was wrong, though expedient. I"
768,"thought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought,"
768,"too, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine’s mental illness:"
768,and then I remembered Mr. Edgar’s stern rebuke of my carrying tales;
768,"and I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by"
768,"affirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it"
768,"merited so harsh an appellation, should be the last. Notwithstanding,"
768,my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many
768,"misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into"
768,Mrs. Linton’s hand.
768,
768,"But here is Kenneth; I’ll go down, and tell him how much better you"
768,"are. My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away"
768,another morning.
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"Dree, and dreary! I reflected as the good woman descended to receive"
768,the doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to
768,amuse me. But never mind! I’ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs.
768,"Dean’s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that"
768,lurks in Catherine Heathcliff’s brilliant eyes. I should be in a
768,"curious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the"
768,daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XV
768,
768,
768,"Another week over—and I am so many days nearer health, and spring! I"
768,"have now heard all my neighbour’s history, at different sittings, as"
768,the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations. I’ll
768,"continue it in her own words, only a little condensed. She is, on the"
768,"whole, a very fair narrator, and I don’t think I could improve her"
768,style.
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I"
768,"knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place;"
768,"and I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my"
768,"pocket, and didn’t want to be threatened or teased any more. I had made"
768,"up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not"
768,"guess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that"
768,it did not reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was
768,"Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to"
768,"church. There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we"
768,generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of
768,service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that
768,"I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would"
768,"be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for"
768,"some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be"
768,"paid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went upstairs."
768,
768,"Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her"
768,"shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual. Her thick, long"
768,"hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now"
768,she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and
768,"neck. Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when"
768,"she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change. The flash of"
768,her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they
768,no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her:
768,"they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond—you would have said"
768,"out of this world. Then, the paleness of her face—its haggard aspect"
768,having vanished as she recovered flesh—and the peculiar expression
768,"arising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their"
768,"causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened;"
768,"and—invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should"
768,"think—refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as"
768,one doomed to decay.
768,
768,"A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible"
768,wind fluttered its leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had laid it
768,"there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or"
768,"occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to"
768,entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her
768,"amusement. She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods"
768,"endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and"
768,"then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the"
768,"saddest of smiles and kisses. At other times, she would turn petulantly"
768,"away, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and"
768,"then he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no"
768,good.
768,
768,"Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of"
768,the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear. It was a sweet
768,"substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which"
768,drowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf. At
768,Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great
768,thaw or a season of steady rain. And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was
768,"thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all;"
768,"but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed"
768,no recognition of material things either by ear or eye.
768,
768,"“There’s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,” I said, gently inserting it in"
768,"one hand that rested on her knee. “You must read it immediately,"
768,"because it wants an answer. Shall I break the seal?” “Yes,” she"
768,"answered, without altering the direction of her eyes. I opened it—it"
768,"was very short. “Now,” I continued, “read it.” She drew away her hand,"
768,"and let it fall. I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it"
768,should please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed
768,"that at last I resumed—“Must I read it, ma’am? It is from Mr."
768,Heathcliff.”
768,
768,"There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle"
768,"to arrange her ideas. She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it;"
768,and when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she
768,"had not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply,"
768,"she merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and"
768,questioning eagerness.
768,
768,"“Well, he wishes to see you,” said I, guessing her need of an"
768,"interpreter. “He’s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know"
768,what answer I shall bring.”
768,
768,"As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath"
768,"raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back,"
768,"announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did"
768,"not consider a stranger. Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened"
768,breathlessly. The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open
768,house was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely
768,"he supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to"
768,trust to his own audacity. With straining eagerness Catherine gazed
768,towards the entrance of her chamber. He did not hit the right room
768,"directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could"
768,"reach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her"
768,grasped in his arms.
768,
768,"He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during"
768,which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life
768,"before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I"
768,"plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look"
768,"into her face! The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the"
768,"instant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery"
768,"there—she was fated, sure to die."
768,
768,"“Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?” was the first sentence he"
768,"uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. And now"
768,he stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his
768,gaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish:
768,they did not melt.
768,
768,"“What now?” said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a"
768,suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly
768,"varying caprices. “You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And"
768,"you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be"
768,"pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me—and thriven on"
768,"it, I think. How strong you are! How many years do you mean to live"
768,after I am gone?”
768,
768,"Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,"
768,"but she seized his hair, and kept him down."
768,
768,"“I wish I could hold you,” she continued, bitterly, “till we were both"
768,dead! I shouldn’t care what you suffered. I care nothing for your
768,sufferings. Why shouldn’t you suffer? I do! Will you forget me? Will
768,"you be happy when I am in the earth? Will you say twenty years hence,"
768,"‘That’s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw? I loved her long ago, and was"
768,wretched to lose her; but it is past. I’ve loved many others since: my
768,"children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not"
768,rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave
768,"them!’ Will you say so, Heathcliff?”"
768,
768,"“Don’t torture me till I’m as mad as yourself,” cried he, wrenching his"
768,"head free, and grinding his teeth."
768,
768,"The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture. Well"
768,"might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her,"
768,unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. Her
768,"present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a"
768,bloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed
768,fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her
768,"companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm"
768,with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the
768,"requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four"
768,distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.
768,
768,"“Are you possessed with a devil,” he pursued, savagely, “to talk in"
768,that manner to me when you are dying? Do you reflect that all those
768,"words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after"
768,"you have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,"
768,"Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is"
768,"it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at"
768,peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?”
768,
768,"“I shall not be at peace,” moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of"
768,"physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which"
768,beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said
768,"nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more"
768,kindly—
768,
768,"“I’m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only"
768,wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you
768,"hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own"
768,"sake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me"
768,"in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember"
768,than my harsh words! Won’t you come here again? Do!”
768,
768,"Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so"
768,"far as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent"
768,"round to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he"
768,"walked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards"
768,us. Mrs. Linton’s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke
768,"a new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she"
768,resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:—
768,
768,"“Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the"
768,"grave. _That_ is how I’m loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_"
768,Heathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he’s in my
768,"soul. And,” added she musingly, “the thing that irks me most is this"
768,"shattered prison, after all. I’m tired of being enclosed here. I’m"
768,"wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there:"
768,"not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the"
768,"walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you"
768,think you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and
768,strength: you are sorry for me—very soon that will be altered. I shall
768,be sorry for _you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I
768,_wonder_ he won’t be near me!” She went on to herself. “I thought he
768,"wished it. Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to"
768,"me, Heathcliff.”"
768,
768,In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the
768,"chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely"
768,"desperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his"
768,"breast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how"
768,"they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her,"
768,and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress
768,"would never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly"
768,"insensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my"
768,"approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at"
768,"me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy"
768,jealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of
768,"my own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I"
768,"spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity."
768,
768,A movement of Catherine’s relieved me a little presently: she put up
768,"her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her;"
768,"while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly—"
768,
768,“You teach me now how cruel you’ve been—cruel and false. _Why_ did you
768,"despise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one"
768,"word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you"
768,"may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they’ll blight"
768,you—they’ll damn you. You loved me—then what _right_ had you to leave
768,me? What right—answer me—for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?
768,"Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or"
768,"Satan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did"
768,it. I have not broken your heart—_you_ have broken it; and in breaking
768,"it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do"
768,"I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you—oh, God! would"
768,_you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?”
768,
768,"“Let me alone. Let me alone,” sobbed Catherine. “If I’ve done wrong,"
768,I’m dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won’t upbraid
768,you! I forgive you. Forgive me!”
768,
768,"“It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those"
768,"wasted hands,” he answered. “Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your"
768,eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer—but
768,_yours_! How can I?”
768,
768,"They were silent—their faces hid against each other, and washed by each"
768,"other’s tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it"
768,seemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.
768,
768,"I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,"
768,"the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could"
768,"distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse"
768,thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.
768,
768,"“Service is over,” I announced. “My master will be here in half an"
768,hour.”
768,
768,"Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never"
768,moved.
768,
768,Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road
768,towards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the
768,"gate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely"
768,afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.
768,
768,"“Now he is here,” I exclaimed. “For heaven’s sake, hurry down! You’ll"
768,not meet any one on the front stairs. Do be quick; and stay among the
768,trees till he is fairly in.”
768,
768,"“I must go, Cathy,” said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from"
768,"his companion’s arms. “But if I live, I’ll see you again before you are"
768,asleep. I won’t stray five yards from your window.”
768,
768,"“You must not go!” she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength"
768,"allowed. “You _shall_ not, I tell you.”"
768,
768,"“For one hour,” he pleaded earnestly."
768,
768,"“Not for one minute,” she replied."
768,
768,"“I _must_—Linton will be up immediately,” persisted the alarmed"
768,intruder.
768,
768,"He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act—she clung fast,"
768,gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.
768,
768,"“No!” she shrieked. “Oh, don’t, don’t go. It is the last time! Edgar"
768,"will not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!”"
768,
768,"“Damn the fool! There he is,” cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his"
768,"seat. “Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I’ll stay. If he shot"
768,"me so, I’d expire with a blessing on my lips.”"
768,
768,And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the
768,stairs—the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.
768,
768,"“Are you going to listen to her ravings?” I said, passionately. “She"
768,"does not know what she says. Will you ruin her, because she has not wit"
768,to help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most
768,"diabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for—master,"
768,"mistress, and servant.”"
768,
768,"I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at"
768,"the noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to"
768,"observe that Catherine’s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung"
768,down.
768,
768,"“She’s fainted, or dead,” I thought: “so much the better. Far better"
768,"that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to"
768,all about her.”
768,
768,"Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and"
768,"rage. What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all"
768,"demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his"
768,arms.
768,
768,"“Look there!” he said. “Unless you be a fiend, help her first—then you"
768,shall speak to me!”
768,
768,"He walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and"
768,"with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to"
768,"restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and"
768,"moaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her"
768,"hated friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and"
768,"besought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he"
768,should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.
768,
768,"“I shall not refuse to go out of doors,” he answered; “but I shall stay"
768,"in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow. I shall"
768,"be under those larch-trees. Mind! or I pay another visit, whether"
768,Linton be in or not.”
768,
768,"He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,"
768,"ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the"
768,house of his luckless presence.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XVI
768,
768,
768,About twelve o’clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at
768,"Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months’ child; and two hours after the"
768,"mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss"
768,"Heathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter’s distraction at his bereavement"
768,is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how
768,"deep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left"
768,"without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and"
768,I mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the
768,"securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son’s. An"
768,"unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life,"
768,"and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence. We"
768,redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as
768,its end is likely to be.
768,
768,Next morning—bright and cheerful out of doors—stole softened in through
768,"the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant"
768,"with a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the"
768,"pillow, and his eyes shut. His young and fair features were almost as"
768,"deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but"
768,"_his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace."
768,"Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a"
768,smile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.
768,And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never
768,in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine
768,rest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours
768,before: “Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth
768,"or now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!”"
768,
768,"I don’t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise"
768,"than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied"
768,or despairing mourner share the duty with me. I see a repose that
768,"neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the"
768,endless and shadowless hereafter—the Eternity they have entered—where
768,"life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in"
768,its fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is
768,"even in a love like Mr. Linton’s, when he so regretted Catherine’s"
768,"blessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward"
768,"and impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of"
768,peace at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not
768,"then, in the presence of her corpse. It asserted its own tranquillity,"
768,which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.
768,
768,"Do you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir? I’d"
768,give a great deal to know.
768,
768,"I declined answering Mrs. Dean’s question, which struck me as something"
768,heterodox. She proceeded:
768,
768,"Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to"
768,think she is; but we’ll leave her with her Maker.
768,
768,"The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the"
768,room and steal out to the pure refreshing air. The servants thought me
768,"gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my"
768,chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff. If he had remained among the
768,"larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the"
768,"Grange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger"
768,"going to Gimmerton. If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware,"
768,"from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of"
768,"the outer doors, that all was not right within. I wished, yet feared,"
768,"to find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get"
768,"it over; but _how_ to do it I did not know. He was there—at least, a"
768,"few yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat"
768,"off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded"
768,"branches, and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long"
768,"time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing"
768,"scarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and"
768,regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They
768,"flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:—“She’s"
768,dead!” he said; “I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your
768,handkerchief away—don’t snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none
768,of _your_ tears!”
768,
768,I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures
768,that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others. When I
768,"first looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of"
768,the catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was
768,"quelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on"
768,the ground.
768,
768,"“Yes, she’s dead!” I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks."
768,"“Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take"
768,due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!”
768,
768,"“Did _she_ take due warning, then?” asked Heathcliff, attempting a"
768,"sneer. “Did she die like a saint? Come, give me a true history of the"
768,event. How did—?”
768,
768,"He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and"
768,"compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,"
768,"defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare."
768,"“How did she die?” he resumed, at last—fain, notwithstanding his"
768,"hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he"
768,"trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends."
768,
768,“Poor wretch!” I thought; “you have a heart and nerves the same as your
768,brother men! Why should you be anxious to conceal them? Your pride
768,"cannot blind God! You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of"
768,humiliation.”
768,
768,"“Quietly as a lamb!” I answered, aloud. “She drew a sigh, and stretched"
768,"herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five"
768,"minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!”"
768,
768,"“And—did she ever mention me?” he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded"
768,the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not
768,bear to hear.
768,
768,“Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you
768,"left her,” I said. “She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her"
768,latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a
768,gentle dream—may she wake as kindly in the other world!”
768,
768,"“May she wake in torment!” he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping"
768,"his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion."
768,"“Why, she’s a liar to the end! Where is she? Not _there_—not in"
768,heaven—not perished—where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my
768,sufferings! And I pray one prayer—I repeat it till my tongue
768,"stiffens—Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;"
768,"you said I killed you—haunt me, then! The murdered _do_ haunt their"
768,"murderers, I believe. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be"
768,with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in
768,"this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh, God! it is unutterable! I"
768,_cannot_ live without my life! I _cannot_ live without my soul!”
768,
768,"He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,"
768,"howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death"
768,with knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the
768,"bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably"
768,the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the
768,"night. It hardly moved my compassion—it appalled me: still, I felt"
768,reluctant to quit him so. But the moment he recollected himself enough
768,"to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I"
768,obeyed. He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!
768,
768,Mrs. Linton’s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday
768,"following her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and"
768,"strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room."
768,"Linton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and—a"
768,"circumstance concealed from all but me—Heathcliff spent his nights, at"
768,"least, outside, equally a stranger to repose. I held no communication"
768,"with him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could;"
768,"and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer"
768,"fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and"
768,opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a
768,chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu. He
768,"did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and"
768,briefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.
768,"Indeed, I shouldn’t have discovered that he had been there, except for"
768,"the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse’s face, and for"
768,"observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver"
768,"thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a"
768,locket hung round Catherine’s neck. Heathcliff had opened the trinket
768,"and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own. I"
768,"twisted the two, and enclosed them together."
768,
768,"Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his"
768,"sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that,"
768,"besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and"
768,servants. Isabella was not asked.
768,
768,"The place of Catherine’s interment, to the surprise of the villagers,"
768,"was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor"
768,"yet by the tombs of her own relations, outside. It was dug on a green"
768,"slope in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath"
768,and bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould
768,almost buries it. Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have
768,"each a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to"
768,mark the graves.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XVII
768,
768,
768,That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening
768,"the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and"
768,"brought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could"
768,hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses
768,"and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent,"
768,"the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary,"
768,"and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his"
768,"room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a"
768,"nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid"
768,"on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still"
768,"driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened,"
768,"and some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was"
768,greater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the
768,"maids, and I cried—“Have done! How dare you show your giddiness here?"
768,What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?”
768,
768,"“Excuse me!” answered a familiar voice; “but I know Edgar is in bed,"
768,and I cannot stop myself.”
768,
768,"With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her"
768,hand to her side.
768,
768,"“I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!” she continued, after"
768,a pause; “except where I’ve flown. I couldn’t count the number of falls
768,"I’ve had. Oh, I’m aching all over! Don’t be alarmed! There shall be an"
768,explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to
768,"step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a"
768,servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.”
768,
768,The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing
768,"predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and"
768,"water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore,"
768,befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short
768,"sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light"
768,"silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by"
768,"thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the"
768,"cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and"
768,"bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and"
768,you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had
768,leisure to examine her.
768,
768,"“My dear young lady,” I exclaimed, “I’ll stir nowhere, and hear"
768,"nothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put"
768,"on dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so"
768,it is needless to order the carriage.”
768,
768,"“Certainly I shall,” she said; “walking or riding: yet I’ve no"
768,"objection to dress myself decently. And—ah, see how it flows down my"
768,neck now! The fire does make it smart.”
768,
768,"She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me"
768,touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get
768,"ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain"
768,her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.
768,
768,"“Now, Ellen,” she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in"
768,"an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, “you sit"
768,"down opposite me, and put poor Catherine’s baby away: I don’t like to"
768,"see it! You mustn’t think I care little for Catherine, because I"
768,"behaved so foolishly on entering: I’ve cried, too, bitterly—yes, more"
768,"than any one else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you"
768,"remember, and I sha’n’t forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not"
768,"going to sympathise with him—the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker!"
768,This is the last thing of his I have about me:” she slipped the gold
768,"ring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. “I’ll smash it!”"
768,"she continued, striking it with childish spite, “and then I’ll burn"
768,it!” and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.
768,"“There! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again. He’d be capable"
768,"of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion"
768,"should possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind,"
768,has he? And I won’t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him
768,"into more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though,"
768,"if I had not learned he was out of the way, I’d have halted at the"
768,"kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted,"
768,and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed—of that
768,"incarnate goblin! Ah, he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It’s"
768,a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn’t have run till
768,"I’d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!”"
768,
768,"“Well, don’t talk so fast, Miss!” I interrupted; “you’ll disorder the"
768,"handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again."
768,"Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is"
768,"sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!”"
768,
768,"“An undeniable truth,” she replied. “Listen to that child! It maintains"
768,a constant wail—send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha’n’t stay
768,any longer.”
768,
768,"I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant’s care; and then I"
768,inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an
768,"unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining"
768,with us.
768,
768,"“I ought, and I wished to remain,” answered she, “to cheer Edgar and"
768,"take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my"
768,right home. But I tell you he wouldn’t let me! Do you think he could
768,bear to see me grow fat and merry—could bear to think that we were
768,"tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the"
768,"satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its"
768,annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I
768,"notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are"
768,involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising
768,from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for
768,"him, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me"
768,"feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing"
768,I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I’ve
768,recovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I’d rather he’d
768,"kill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I’m at my"
768,ease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I
768,"could still be loving him, if—no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the"
768,devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine
768,"had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so"
768,"well. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out"
768,of my memory!”
768,
768,"“Hush, hush! He’s a human being,” I said. “Be more charitable: there"
768,are worse men than he is yet!”
768,
768,"“He’s not a human being,” she retorted; “and he has no claim on my"
768,"charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and"
768,"flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he"
768,"has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,"
768,"though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood"
768,"for Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn’t!” And here Isabella began"
768,"to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she"
768,"recommenced. “You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was"
768,"compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a"
768,pitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers
768,requires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to
768,"forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous"
768,violence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the
768,"sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly"
768,broke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a
768,signal revenge.
768,
768,"“Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral. He"
768,kept himself sober for the purpose—tolerably sober: not going to bed
768,"mad at six o’clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently, he"
768,"rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance;"
768,"and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by"
768,tumblerfuls.
768,
768,“Heathcliff—I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house
768,"from last Sunday till to-day. Whether the angels have fed him, or his"
768,"kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for"
768,"nearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his"
768,chamber; locking himself in—as if anybody dreamt of coveting his
768,"company! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the"
768,"deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed,"
768,was curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding
768,these precious orisons—and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse
768,and his voice was strangled in his throat—he would be off again; always
768,straight down to the Grange! I wonder Edgar did not send for a
768,"constable, and give him into custody! For me, grieved as I was about"
768,"Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of"
768,deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.
768,
768,“I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph’s eternal lectures
768,"without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot"
768,of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn’t think that I should
768,cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable
768,"companions. I’d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than"
768,"with ‘t’ little maister’ and his staunch supporter, that odious old"
768,"man! When Heathcliff is in, I’m often obliged to seek the kitchen and"
768,"their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he"
768,"is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one"
768,"corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy"
768,himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter
768,"now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and"
768,"depressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he’s sure he’s an altered"
768,"man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ‘so as by"
768,fire.’ I’m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is
768,not my business.
768,
768,“Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on
768,"towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow"
768,"blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard"
768,and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page
768,"before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place."
768,"Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on"
768,the same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below
768,"irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three"
768,"hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which"
768,"shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals,"
768,and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of
768,the candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was
768,"very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy"
768,"had vanished from the world, never to be restored."
768,
768,“The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen
768,latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual;
768,"owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and"
768,we heard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an
768,"irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my"
768,"companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at"
768,me.
768,
768,"“‘I’ll keep him out five minutes,’ he exclaimed. ‘You won’t object?’"
768,
768,"“‘No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,’ I answered. ‘Do!"
768,"put the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.’"
768,
768,“Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then
768,"came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over"
768,"it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that"
768,"gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he"
768,couldn’t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him
768,to speak.
768,
768,"“‘You, and I,’ he said, ‘have each a great debt to settle with the man"
768,"out yonder! If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to"
768,discharge it. Are you as soft as your brother? Are you willing to
768,"endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?’"
768,
768,"“‘I’m weary of enduring now,’ I replied; ‘and I’d be glad of a"
768,retaliation that wouldn’t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence
768,are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them
768,worse than their enemies.’
768,
768,“‘Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!’
768,"cried Hindley. ‘Mrs. Heathcliff, I’ll ask you to do nothing; but sit"
768,"still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I’m sure you would have as"
768,much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend’s
768,existence; he’ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he’ll be
768,_my_ ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he
768,"were master here already! Promise to hold your tongue, and before that"
768,clock strikes—it wants three minutes of one—you’re a free woman!’
768,
768,“He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his
768,"breast, and would have turned down the candle. I snatched it away,"
768,"however, and seized his arm."
768,
768,“‘I’ll not hold my tongue!’ I said; ‘you mustn’t touch him. Let the
768,"door remain shut, and be quiet!’"
768,
768,"“‘No! I’ve formed my resolution, and by God I’ll execute it!’ cried the"
768,"desperate being. ‘I’ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and"
768,Hareton justice! And you needn’t trouble your head to screen me;
768,"Catherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though"
768,I cut my throat this minute—and it’s time to make an end!’
768,
768,"“I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a"
768,lunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his
768,intended victim of the fate which awaited him.
768,
768,"“‘You’d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!’ I exclaimed, in"
768,"rather a triumphant tone. ‘Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you"
768,persist in endeavouring to enter.’
768,
768,"“‘You’d better open the door, you—’ he answered, addressing me by some"
768,elegant term that I don’t care to repeat.
768,
768,"“‘I shall not meddle in the matter,’ I retorted again. ‘Come in and get"
768,"shot, if you please. I’ve done my duty.’"
768,
768,“With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire;
768,having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any
768,anxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at
768,me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of
768,"names for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and"
768,"conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be"
768,for _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing
768,for _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing
768,"these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by"
768,"a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked"
768,blightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his
768,"shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His"
768,"hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth,"
768,"revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark."
768,
768,"“‘Isabella, let me in, or I’ll make you repent!’ he ‘girned,’ as Joseph"
768,calls it.
768,
768,"“‘I cannot commit murder,’ I replied. ‘Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with"
768,a knife and loaded pistol.’
768,
768,"“‘Let me in by the kitchen door,’ he said."
768,
768,"“‘Hindley will be there before me,’ I answered: ‘and that’s a poor love"
768,of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow! We were left at peace in
768,"our beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of"
768,"winter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you,"
768,I’d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The
768,"world is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly"
768,impressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life:
768,I can’t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.’
768,
768,"“‘He’s there, is he?’ exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap. ‘If I"
768,can get my arm out I can hit him!’
768,
768,"“I’m afraid, Ellen, you’ll set me down as really wicked; but you don’t"
768,"know all, so don’t judge. I wouldn’t have aided or abetted an attempt"
768,"on even _his_ life for anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and"
768,"therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the"
768,"consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw’s"
768,weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.
768,
768,"“The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its"
768,"owner’s wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the"
768,"flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then"
768,"took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang"
768,in. His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow
768,"of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian"
768,"kicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the"
768,"flags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning"
768,Joseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing
768,"him completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and"
768,dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore
768,"off the sleeve of Earnshaw’s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal"
768,roughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically
768,"as he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking"
768,"the old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my"
768,"hasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at"
768,once.
768,
768,"“‘What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?’"
768,
768,"“‘There’s this to do,’ thundered Heathcliff, ‘that your master’s mad;"
768,"and should he last another month, I’ll have him to an asylum. And how"
768,"the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don’t"
768,"stand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I’m not going to nurse him."
768,Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle—it is more
768,than half brandy!’
768,
768,"“‘And so ye’ve been murthering on him?’ exclaimed Joseph, lifting his"
768,hands and eyes in horror. ‘If iver I seed a seeght loike this! May the
768,Lord—’
768,
768,"“Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,"
768,"and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he"
768,"joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its"
768,odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at
768,"nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves"
768,at the foot of the gallows.
768,
768,"“‘Oh, I forgot you,’ said the tyrant. ‘You shall do that. Down with"
768,"you. And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper? There, that"
768,is work fit for you!’
768,
768,"“He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who"
768,"steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would"
768,"set off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and"
768,"though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. He was so"
768,"obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to"
768,compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing
768,"over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the"
768,account in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour
768,to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor;
768,"especially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon"
768,convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a
768,"dose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained"
768,"motion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was"
768,"ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him"
768,deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious
768,"conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us,"
768,"after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on"
768,"the hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had"
768,escaped so easily.
768,
768,"“This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr."
768,"Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost"
768,"as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared"
768,"inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I"
768,"commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I"
768,"experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at"
768,"intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the"
768,"comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured"
768,"on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw’s"
768,"seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him."
768,
768,"“Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his"
768,features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His
768,"forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so"
768,"diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were"
768,"nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes"
768,"were wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in"
768,"an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have"
768,"covered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his_ case, I was"
768,"gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I"
768,couldn’t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the
768,only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.”
768,
768,"“Fie, fie, Miss!” I interrupted. “One might suppose you had never"
768,"opened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that"
768,ought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your
768,torture to his!”
768,
768,"“In general I’ll allow that it would be, Ellen,” she continued; “but"
768,"what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand"
768,"in it? I’d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings"
768,"and he might _know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much. On"
768,"only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an"
768,"eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a"
768,"wrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him"
768,"the first to implore pardon; and then—why then, Ellen, I might show you"
768,"some generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged,"
768,"and therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I"
768,"handed him a glass, and asked him how he was."
768,
768,"“‘Not as ill as I wish,’ he replied. ‘But leaving out my arm, every"
768,inch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!’
768,
768,"“‘Yes, no wonder,’ was my next remark. ‘Catherine used to boast that"
768,she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons
768,would not hurt you for fear of offending her. It’s well people don’t
768,"_really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have"
768,"witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your"
768,chest and shoulders?’
768,
768,"“‘I can’t say,’ he answered; ‘but what do you mean? Did he dare to"
768,strike me when I was down?’
768,
768,"“‘He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,’ I"
768,whispered. ‘And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because
768,"he’s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.’"
768,
768,"“Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;"
768,"who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:"
768,"the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their"
768,blackness through his features.
768,
768,"“‘Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last"
768,"agony, I’d go to hell with joy,’ groaned the impatient man, writhing to"
768,"rise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the"
768,struggle.
768,
768,"“‘Nay, it’s enough that he has murdered one of you,’ I observed aloud."
768,"‘At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now"
768,"had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff. After all, it is preferable to be"
768,hated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were—how happy
768,Catherine was before he came—I’m fit to curse the day.’
768,
768,"“Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than"
768,"the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw,"
768,"for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath"
768,"in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The"
768,clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which
768,"usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not"
768,fear to hazard another sound of derision.
768,
768,"“‘Get up, and begone out of my sight,’ said the mourner."
768,
768,"“I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was"
768,hardly intelligible.
768,
768,"“‘I beg your pardon,’ I replied. ‘But I loved Catherine too; and her"
768,"brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now"
768,"that she’s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if"
768,"you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and"
768,her—’
768,
768,"“‘Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!’ he cried,"
768,making a movement that caused me to make one also.
768,
768,"“‘But then,’ I continued, holding myself ready to flee, ‘if poor"
768,"Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,"
768,"degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a"
768,similar picture! _She_ wouldn’t have borne your abominable behaviour
768,quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.’
768,
768,“The back of the settle and Earnshaw’s person interposed between me and
768,"him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife"
768,"from the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and"
768,"stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to"
768,the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than
768,his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his
768,"part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together"
768,on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to
768,"his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies"
768,"from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from"
768,"purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,"
768,"quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,"
768,"and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the"
768,beacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a
768,"perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,"
768,abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.”
768,
768,"Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and"
768,"bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and"
768,"turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she"
768,"stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar’s and Catherine’s portraits,"
768,"bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage,"
768,"accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her"
768,"mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but"
768,a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when
768,"things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south,"
768,near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her
768,"escape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him"
768,"to be an ailing, peevish creature."
768,
768,"Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she"
768,"lived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment,"
768,only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with
768,"him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information,"
768,"he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of"
768,"residence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn’t molest her:"
768,"for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often"
768,"asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled"
768,"grimly, and observed: “They wish me to hate it too, do they?”"
768,
768,"“I don’t think they wish you to know anything about it,” I answered."
768,
768,"“But I’ll have it,” he said, “when I want it. They may reckon on that!”"
768,
768,Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen
768,"years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a"
768,little more.
768,
768,On the day succeeding Isabella’s unexpected visit I had no opportunity
768,"of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for"
768,"discussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased"
768,him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an
768,intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to
768,"allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from"
768,"going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief,"
768,"and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up"
768,"his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the"
768,"village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within"
768,the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on
768,"the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or"
768,early morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good
768,to be thoroughly unhappy long. _He_ didn’t pray for Catherine’s soul to
768,"haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than"
768,"common joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and"
768,hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was
768,gone.
768,
768,"And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I"
768,"said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that"
768,"coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could"
768,stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot’s sceptre in his
768,"heart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,"
768,as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because
768,Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it
768,"formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with"
768,"her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than"
768,from its being his own.
768,
768,"I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and"
768,perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so
768,"opposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands,"
768,and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they
768,"shouldn’t both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I"
768,"thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has"
768,"shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck,"
768,"the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save"
768,"her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless"
768,"vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal"
768,"and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped,"
768,"and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were"
768,righteously doomed to endure them. But you’ll not want to hear my
768,"moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you’ll judge, as well as I can, all these"
768,"things: at least, you’ll think you will, and that’s the same. The end"
768,of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his
768,"sister’s: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the"
768,"Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it;"
768,all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the
768,preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to
768,my master.
768,
768,"“Well, Nelly,” said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not"
768,"to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, “it’s yours and"
768,"my turn to go into mourning at present. Who’s given us the slip now, do"
768,you think?”
768,
768,“Who?” I asked in a flurry.
768,
768,"“Why, guess!” he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a"
768,hook by the door. “And nip up the corner of your apron: I’m certain
768,you’ll need it.”
768,
768,"“Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?” I exclaimed."
768,
768,"“What! would you have tears for him?” said the doctor. “No,"
768,Heathcliff’s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I’ve just
768,seen him. He’s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.”
768,
768,"“Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?” I repeated impatiently."
768,
768,"“Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,” he replied, “and my wicked"
768,gossip: though he’s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said
768,we should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character:
768,"drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I’m sorry, too. One can’t help missing an"
768,old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man
768,"imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He’s barely"
768,"twenty-seven, it seems; that’s your own age: who would have thought you"
768,were born in one year?”
768,
768,I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton’s
768,death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the
768,"porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get"
768,another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder
768,myself from pondering on the question—“Had he had fair play?” Whatever
768,"I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious"
768,"that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and"
768,assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely
768,"reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless"
768,condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother
768,"had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded"
768,"him that the child Hareton was his wife’s nephew, and, in the absence"
768,"of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and"
768,"must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of"
768,"his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then,"
768,but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.
768,"His lawyer had been Earnshaw’s also: I called at the village, and asked"
768,"him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff"
768,"should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would"
768,be found little else than a beggar.
768,
768,"“His father died in debt,” he said; “the whole property is mortgaged,"
768,and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity
768,"of creating some interest in the creditor’s heart, that he may be"
768,inclined to deal leniently towards him.”
768,
768,"When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see"
768,"everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient"
768,"distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he"
768,did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the
768,"arrangements for the funeral, if I chose."
768,
768,"“Correctly,” he remarked, “that fool’s body should be buried at the"
768,"cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten"
768,"minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two"
768,"doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking"
768,"himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard"
768,"him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:"
768,"flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth,"
768,and he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was
768,"both dead and cold, and stark; and so you’ll allow it was useless"
768,making more stir about him!”
768,
768,"The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:"
768,
768,“I’d rayther he’d goan hisseln for t’ doctor! I sud ha’ taen tent o’ t’
768,"maister better nor him—and he warn’t deead when I left, naught o’ t’"
768,soart!”
768,
768,I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I
768,"might have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that"
768,the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a
768,"hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if"
768,"anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult"
768,"work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like"
768,exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the
768,coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and
768,"previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on"
768,"to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, “Now, my bonny lad, you"
768,"are _mine_! And we’ll see if one tree won’t grow as crooked as another,"
768,with the same wind to twist it!” The unsuspecting thing was pleased at
768,"this speech: he played with Heathcliff’s whiskers, and stroked his"
768,"cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, “That boy must"
768,"go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the"
768,world less yours than he is!”
768,
768,“Does Linton say so?” he demanded.
768,
768,"“Of course—he has ordered me to take him,” I replied."
768,
768,"“Well,” said the scoundrel, “we’ll not argue the subject now: but I"
768,have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your
768,"master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt"
768,to remove it. I don’t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I’ll be
768,pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.”
768,
768,This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my
768,"return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke"
768,no more of interfering. I’m not aware that he could have done it to any
768,"purpose, had he been ever so willing."
768,
768,The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm
768,"possession, and proved to the attorney—who, in his turn, proved it to"
768,Mr. Linton—that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for
768,"cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the"
768,"mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first"
768,"gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete"
768,dependence on his father’s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house
768,"as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right"
768,"himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has"
768,been wronged.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XVIII
768,
768,
768,"The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period"
768,were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage
768,"rose from our little lady’s trifling illnesses, which she had to"
768,"experience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest,"
768,"after the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and"
768,"talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over"
768,Mrs. Linton’s dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought
768,"sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the"
768,"Earnshaws’ handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons’ fair skin and small"
768,"features, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not"
768,"rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its"
768,affections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her
768,mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild
768,"as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger"
768,was never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.
768,"However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A"
768,"propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged"
768,"children invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If"
768,"a servant chanced to vex her, it was always—“I shall tell papa!” And if"
768,"he reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a"
768,heart-breaking business: I don’t believe he ever did speak a harsh word
768,"to her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an"
768,"amusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt"
768,"scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his"
768,teaching.
768,
768,Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the
768,range of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile
768,"or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else."
768,"Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only"
768,"building she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering"
768,Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect
768,"recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while"
768,"surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe—"
768,
768,"“Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those"
768,hills? I wonder what lies on the other side—is it the sea?”
768,
768,"“No, Miss Cathy,” I would answer; “it is hills again, just like these.”"
768,
768,“And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?” she
768,once asked.
768,
768,The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her
768,notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost
768,"heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I"
768,"explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth"
768,in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.
768,
768,“And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?” she
768,pursued.
768,
768,"“Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,” replied I; “you"
768,"could not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost"
768,is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have
768,found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!”
768,
768,"“Oh, you have been on them!” she cried gleefully. “Then I can go, too,"
768,"when I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?”"
768,
768,"“Papa would tell you, Miss,” I answered, hastily, “that they are not"
768,"worth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him,"
768,are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.”
768,
768,"“But I know the park, and I don’t know those,” she murmured to herself."
768,“And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest
768,point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.”
768,
768,"One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with"
768,a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he
768,promised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss
768,"Catherine measured her age by months, and, “Now, am I old enough to go"
768,to Penistone Crags?” was the constant question in her mouth. The road
768,thither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to
768,"pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, “Not yet, love: not"
768,yet.”
768,
768,I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her
768,husband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both
768,lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.
768,"What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of"
768,"the same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but"
768,"incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to"
768,inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months’
768,"indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come"
768,"to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid"
768,"him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that"
768,"Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she"
768,"would fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his"
768,maintenance or education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying
768,"with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls,"
768,"he flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance,"
768,"in his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of"
768,"the park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going"
768,unaccompanied.
768,
768,He was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner
768,"of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet"
768,state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval
768,"of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then,"
768,"to run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might"
768,entertain herself. I used to send her on her travels round the
768,"grounds—now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient"
768,audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.
768,
768,The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this
768,solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast
768,till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful
768,tales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were
768,"generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,"
768,"if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced."
768,"Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o’clock, and said she was"
768,"that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his"
768,caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and
768,"beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a"
768,"couple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung"
768,them in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as
768,"a fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July"
768,"sun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to"
768,"avoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing never made her"
768,"appearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond"
768,"of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two"
768,pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down
768,"this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her"
768,"myself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on"
768,the borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young
768,lady.
768,
768,"“I saw her at morn,” he replied: “she would have me to cut her a hazel"
768,"switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it"
768,"is lowest, and galloped out of sight.”"
768,
768,You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly
768,she must have started for Penistone Crags. “What will become of her?” I
768,"ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and"
768,"making straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile"
768,"after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no"
768,"Catherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a"
768,"half beyond Mr. Heathcliff’s place, and that is four from the Grange,"
768,so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. “And what
768,"if she should have slipped in clambering among them,” I reflected, “and"
768,"been killed, or broken some of her bones?” My suspense was truly"
768,"painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in"
768,"hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying"
768,"under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket"
768,"and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I"
768,"knew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been"
768,servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.
768,
768,"“Ah,” said she, “you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don’t be"
768,frightened. She’s here safe: but I’m glad it isn’t the master.”
768,
768,"“He is not at home then, is he?” I panted, quite breathless with quick"
768,walking and alarm.
768,
768,"“No, no,” she replied: “both he and Joseph are off, and I think they"
768,won’t return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.”
768,
768,"I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking"
768,herself in a little chair that had been her mother’s when a child. Her
768,"hat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home,"
768,"laughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton—now"
768,"a great, strong lad of eighteen—who stared at her with considerable"
768,curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent
768,succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased
768,pouring forth.
768,
768,"“Very well, Miss!” I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry"
768,"countenance. “This is your last ride, till papa comes back. I’ll not"
768,"trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!”"
768,
768,"“Aha, Ellen!” she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. “I"
768,shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you’ve found me out.
768,Have you ever been here in your life before?”
768,
768,"“Put that hat on, and home at once,” said I. “I’m dreadfully grieved at"
768,"you, Miss Cathy: you’ve done extremely wrong! It’s no use pouting and"
768,"crying: that won’t repay the trouble I’ve had, scouring the country"
768,after you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you
768,"stealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will"
768,put faith in you any more.”
768,
768,"“What have I done?” sobbed she, instantly checked. “Papa charged me"
768,"nothing: he’ll not scold me, Ellen—he’s never cross, like you!”"
768,
768,"“Come, come!” I repeated. “I’ll tie the riband. Now, let us have no"
768,"petulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!”"
768,
768,"This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and"
768,retreating to the chimney out of my reach.
768,
768,"“Nay,” said the servant, “don’t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean."
768,"We made her stop: she’d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be"
768,"uneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it’s a"
768,wild road over the hills.”
768,
768,"Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets,"
768,too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my
768,intrusion.
768,
768,"“How long am I to wait?” I continued, disregarding the woman’s"
768,"interference. “It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss"
768,"Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so"
768,please yourself.”
768,
768,"“The pony is in the yard,” she replied, “and Phoenix is shut in there."
768,He’s bitten—and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it;
768,"but you are in a bad temper, and don’t deserve to hear.”"
768,
768,"I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving"
768,"that the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering"
768,"round the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under"
768,"and behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue."
768,"Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more"
768,"impertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation,—“Well, Miss"
768,"Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is you’d be glad enough to"
768,get out.”
768,
768,"“It’s _your_ father’s, isn’t it?” said she, turning to Hareton."
768,
768,"“Nay,” he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully."
768,
768,"He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just"
768,his own.
768,
768,“Whose then—your master’s?” she asked.
768,
768,"He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and"
768,turned away.
768,
768,"“Who is his master?” continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. “He"
768,"talked about ‘our house,’ and ‘our folk.’ I thought he had been the"
768,"owner’s son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn’t he,"
768,if he’s a servant?”
768,
768,Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I
768,"silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her"
768,for departure.
768,
768,"“Now, get my horse,” she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she"
768,would one of the stable-boys at the Grange. “And you may come with me.
768,"I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear"
768,"about the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What’s the"
768,"matter? Get my horse, I say.”"
768,
768,“I’ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!” growled the lad.
768,
768,“You’ll see me _what?_” asked Catherine in surprise.
768,
768,“Damned—thou saucy witch!” he replied.
768,
768,"“There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,” I"
768,interposed. “Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don’t begin to
768,"dispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.”"
768,
768,"“But, Ellen,” cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, “how dare he"
768,speak so to me? Mustn’t he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked
768,"creature, I shall tell papa what you said.—Now, then!”"
768,
768,Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into
768,"her eyes with indignation. “You bring the pony,” she exclaimed, turning"
768,"to the woman, “and let my dog free this moment!”"
768,
768,"“Softly, Miss,” answered the addressed. “You’ll lose nothing by being"
768,"civil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master’s son, he’s your"
768,cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.”
768,
768,"“_He_ my cousin!” cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh."
768,
768,"“Yes, indeed,” responded her reprover."
768,
768,"“Oh, Ellen! don’t let them say such things,” she pursued in great"
768,trouble. “Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a
768,"gentleman’s son. That my—” she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the"
768,bare notion of relationship with such a clown.
768,
768,"“Hush, hush!” I whispered; “people can have many cousins and of all"
768,"sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they"
768,"needn’t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.”"
768,
768,"“He’s not—he’s not my cousin, Ellen!” she went on, gathering fresh"
768,"grief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge"
768,from the idea.
768,
768,I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;
768,"having no doubt of Linton’s approaching arrival, communicated by the"
768,"former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that"
768,Catherine’s first thought on her father’s return would be to seek an
768,explanation of the latter’s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.
768,"Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant,"
768,"seemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the"
768,"door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp"
768,"from the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he"
768,"meant nought. Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a"
768,"glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew."
768,
768,I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor
768,"fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,"
768,"and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily"
768,occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after
768,"rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a"
768,mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. Good
768,"things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far"
768,"over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a"
768,"wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and"
768,"favourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated"
768,"him physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no"
768,temptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid
768,"susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in"
768,Heathcliff’s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on
768,making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked
768,for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single
768,"step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice. And"
768,"from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a"
768,"narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as"
768,"a boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in"
768,"the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children,"
768,"of putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek"
768,"solace in drink by what he termed their “offald ways,” so at present he"
768,laid the whole burden of Hareton’s faults on the shoulders of the
768,"usurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn’t correct him: nor"
768,"however culpably he behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently,"
768,to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined:
768,that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that
768,Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton’s blood would be required at his
768,hands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had
768,"instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had"
768,"he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the"
768,Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he
768,confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private
768,comminations. I don’t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode
768,of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak
768,from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff
768,"was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,"
768,"inside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female"
768,"management, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley’s time were not"
768,now enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek
768,"companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet."
768,
768,"This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy"
768,"rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs,"
768,Charlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we
768,"set out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not"
768,"wring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I"
768,"supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she"
768,"arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton"
768,"happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who"
768,"attacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could"
768,separate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who
768,"she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way:"
768,"finally, beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the"
768,"Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I"
768,was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.
768,"I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she"
768,hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff’s
768,housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then the language he
768,"had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always “love,” and"
768,"“darling,” and “queen,” and “angel,” with everybody at the Grange, to"
768,be insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and
768,hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the
768,grievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole
768,"household at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had"
768,"been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my"
768,"negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should"
768,have to leave; and Cathy couldn’t bear that prospect: she pledged her
768,"word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl."
768,

768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XIX
768,
768,
768,"A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master’s return."
768,Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his
768,"daughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his"
768,youthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming
768,her father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the
768,innumerable excellencies of her “real” cousin. The evening of their
768,expected arrival came. Since early morning she had been busy ordering
768,her own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock—poor
768,thing! her aunt’s death impressed her with no definite sorrow—she
768,"obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the"
768,grounds to meet them.
768,
768,"“Linton is just six months younger than I am,” she chattered, as we"
768,"strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under"
768,shadow of the trees. “How delightful it will be to have him for a
768,playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it
768,"was lighter than mine—more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it"
768,carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I’ve often thought what
768,"a pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy—and papa, dear,"
768,"dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.”"
768,
768,"She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober"
768,"footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy"
768,"bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was"
768,impossible: she couldn’t be still a minute.
768,
768,"“How long they are!” she exclaimed. “Ah, I see some dust on the"
768,road—they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a
768,"little way—half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to"
768,that clump of birches at the turn!”
768,
768,I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling
768,carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her
768,arms as soon as she caught her father’s face looking from the window.
768,"He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval"
768,elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While
768,they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was
768,"asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had"
768,"been winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been"
768,"taken for my master’s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:"
768,but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton
768,"never had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised"
768,"me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had"
768,"fatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father"
768,"told her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I"
768,hastened before to prepare the servants.
768,
768,"“Now, darling,” said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they"
768,halted at the bottom of the front steps: “your cousin is not so strong
768,"or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very"
768,"short time since; therefore, don’t expect him to play and run about"
768,with you directly. And don’t harass him much by talking: let him be
768,"quiet this evening, at least, will you?”"
768,
768,"“Yes, yes, papa,” answered Catherine: “but I do want to see him; and he"
768,hasn’t once looked out.”
768,
768,"The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the"
768,ground by his uncle.
768,
768,"“This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,” he said, putting their little"
768,hands together. “She’s fond of you already; and mind you don’t grieve
768,her by crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an
768,"end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you"
768,please.”
768,
768,"“Let me go to bed, then,” answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine’s"
768,salute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.
768,
768,"“Come, come, there’s a good child,” I whispered, leading him in."
768,“You’ll make her weep too—see how sorry she is for you!”
768,
768,"I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as"
768,"sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three"
768,"entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I"
768,"proceeded to remove Linton’s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair"
768,by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.
768,My master inquired what was the matter.
768,
768,"“I can’t sit on a chair,” sobbed the boy."
768,
768,"“Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,” answered"
768,his uncle patiently.
768,
768,"He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his"
768,"fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down."
768,Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat
768,silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her
768,"little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking"
768,"his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,"
768,"like a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his"
768,"eyes, and lightened into a faint smile."
768,
768,"“Oh, he’ll do very well,” said the master to me, after watching them a"
768,"minute. “Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child"
768,"of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for"
768,strength he’ll gain it.”
768,
768,"“Ay, if we can keep him!” I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came"
768,"over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how"
768,ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father
768,"and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they’ll be. Our doubts were"
768,presently decided—even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the
768,"children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep—he"
768,would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case—I had come
768,"down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom"
768,"candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and"
768,"informed me that Mr. Heathcliff’s servant Joseph was at the door, and"
768,wished to speak with the master.
768,
768,"“I shall ask him what he wants first,” I said, in considerable"
768,"trepidation. “A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the"
768,instant they have returned from a long journey. I don’t think the
768,master can see him.”
768,
768,"Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and"
768,now presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday
768,"garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding"
768,"his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean"
768,his shoes on the mat.
768,
768,"“Good-evening, Joseph,” I said, coldly. “What business brings you here"
768,to-night?”
768,
768,"“It’s Maister Linton I mun spake to,” he answered, waving me"
768,disdainfully aside.
768,
768,“Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to
768,"say, I’m sure he won’t hear it now,” I continued. “You had better sit"
768,"down in there, and entrust your message to me.”"
768,
768,"“Which is his rahm?” pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed"
768,doors.
768,
768,"I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I"
768,"went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor,"
768,advising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no
768,"time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and,"
768,"pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the"
768,"table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began"
768,"in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition—"
768,
768,"“Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn’t goa back ’bout him.”"
768,
768,Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow
768,overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own
768,"account; but, recalling Isabella’s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes"
768,"for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved"
768,"bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart"
768,how it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of
768,any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more
768,"peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. However, he was"
768,not going to rouse him from his sleep.
768,
768,"“Tell Mr. Heathcliff,” he answered calmly, “that his son shall come to"
768,"Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the"
768,distance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired
768,"him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is"
768,very precarious.”
768,
768,"“Noa!” said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and"
768,assuming an authoritative air. “Noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks
768,"noa ’count o’ t’ mother, nor ye norther; but he’ll hev his lad; und I"
768,mun tak’ him—soa now ye knaw!”
768,
768,“You shall not to-night!” answered Linton decisively. “Walk down stairs
768,"at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him"
768,down. Go—”
768,
768,"And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room"
768,of him and closed the door.
768,
768,"“Varrah weell!” shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. “To-morn, he’s"
768,"come hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!”"

768,
768,CHAPTER XX
768,
768,
768,"To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton"
768,"commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine’s pony; and,"
768,"said he—“As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or"
768,"bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she"
768,"cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain"
768,"in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious"
768,"to visit the Heights. Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly,"
768,and he has been obliged to leave us.”
768,
768,"Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o’clock,"
768,and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further
768,travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going
768,"to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see"
768,"him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should"
768,recover from his late journey.
768,
768,"“My father!” he cried, in strange perplexity. “Mamma never told me I"
768,had a father. Where does he live? I’d rather stay with uncle.”
768,
768,"“He lives a little distance from the Grange,” I replied; “just beyond"
768,"those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get"
768,"hearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try"
768,"to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.”"
768,
768,“But why have I not heard of him before?” asked Linton. “Why didn’t
768,"mamma and he live together, as other people do?”"
768,
768,"“He had business to keep him in the north,” I answered, “and your"
768,mother’s health required her to reside in the south.”
768,
768,“And why didn’t mamma speak to me about him?” persevered the child.
768,"“She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I"
768,to love papa? I don’t know him.”
768,
768,"“Oh, all children love their parents,” I said. “Your mother, perhaps,"
768,thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to
768,you. Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is
768,much preferable to an hour’s more sleep.”
768,
768,"“Is _she_ to go with us,” he demanded, “the little girl I saw"
768,yesterday?”
768,
768,"“Not now,” replied I."
768,
768,“Is uncle?” he continued.
768,
768,"“No, I shall be your companion there,” I said."
768,
768,Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.
768,
768,"“I won’t go without uncle,” he cried at length: “I can’t tell where you"
768,mean to take me.”
768,
768,I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to
768,meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards
768,"dressing, and I had to call for my master’s assistance in coaxing him"
768,"out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive"
768,assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy
768,"would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I"
768,invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure
768,"heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of"
768,"Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put"
768,"questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater"
768,interest and liveliness.
768,
768,“Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?” he
768,"inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light"
768,mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.
768,
768,"“It is not so buried in trees,” I replied, “and it is not quite so"
768,"large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air"
768,"is healthier for you—fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the"
768,building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the
768,next best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on
768,"the moors. Hareton Earnshaw—that is, Miss Cathy’s other cousin, and so"
768,yours in a manner—will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can
768,"bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,"
768,"now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,"
768,walk out on the hills.”
768,
768,“And what is my father like?” he asked. “Is he as young and handsome as
768,uncle?”
768,
768,"“He’s as young,” said I; “but he has black hair and eyes, and looks"
768,sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He’ll not seem to you
768,"so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,"
768,"mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he’ll be fonder"
768,"of you than any uncle, for you are his own.”"
768,
768,“Black hair and eyes!” mused Linton. “I can’t fancy him. Then I am not
768,"like him, am I?”"
768,
768,"“Not much,” I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret"
768,"the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large"
768,"languid eyes—his mother’s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness"
768,"kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit."
768,
768,“How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!” he
768,"murmured. “Has he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I"
768,remember not a single thing about him!”
768,
768,"“Why, Master Linton,” said I, “three hundred miles is a great distance;"
768,and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person
768,compared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff
768,"proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient"
768,opportunity; and now it is too late. Don’t trouble him with questions
768,"on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.”"
768,
768,The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder
768,"of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched"
768,to catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved
768,"front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and"
768,"crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his"
768,private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.
768,But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation
768,"within. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was"
768,half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was
768,clearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his master’s chair
768,telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing
768,for the hayfield.
768,
768,"“Hallo, Nelly!” said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. “I feared I should"
768,"have to come down and fetch my property myself. You’ve brought it, have"
768,you? Let us see what we can make of it.”
768,
768,He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping
768,curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the
768,three.
768,
768,"“Sure-ly,” said Joseph after a grave inspection, “he’s swopped wi’ ye,"
768,"Maister, an’ yon’s his lass!”"
768,
768,"Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a"
768,scornful laugh.
768,
768,"“God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!” he exclaimed."
768,"“Hav’n’t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my"
768,soul! but that’s worse than I expected—and the devil knows I was not
768,sanguine!”
768,
768,"I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did"
768,"not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father’s speech, or"
768,"whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that"
768,"the grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with"
768,growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff’s taking a seat and bidding
768,him “come hither” he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.
768,
768,"“Tut, tut!” said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him"
768,"roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin."
768,"“None of that nonsense! We’re not going to hurt thee, Linton—isn’t that"
768,"thy name? Thou art thy mother’s child, entirely! Where is _my_ share in"
768,"thee, puling chicken?”"
768,
768,"He took off the boy’s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt"
768,his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton
768,"ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector."
768,
768,"“Do you know me?” asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the"
768,limbs were all equally frail and feeble.
768,
768,"“No,” said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear."
768,
768,"“You’ve heard of me, I daresay?”"
768,
768,"“No,” he replied again."
768,
768,"“No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for"
768,"me! You are my son, then, I’ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked"
768,slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.
768,"Now, don’t wince, and colour up! Though it _is_ something to see you"
768,"have not white blood. Be a good lad; and I’ll do for you. Nelly, if you"
768,"be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you’ll"
768,report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this
768,thing won’t be settled while you linger about it.”
768,
768,"“Well,” replied I, “I hope you’ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff,"
768,or you’ll not keep him long; and he’s all you have akin in the wide
768,"world, that you will ever know—remember.”"
768,
768,"“I’ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn’t fear,” he said, laughing."
768,“Only nobody else must be kind to him: I’m jealous of monopolising his
768,"affection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some"
768,"breakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,”"
768,"he added, when they had departed, “my son is prospective owner of your"
768,"place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his"
768,"successor. Besides, he’s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_"
768,descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children
768,to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration
768,"which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate"
768,him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient:
768,"he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master"
768,"tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome"
768,"style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from"
768,"twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve"
768,ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with
768,"a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his"
768,"associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the"
768,"trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a"
768,worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the
768,"whey-faced, whining wretch!”"
768,
768,"While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of"
768,"milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the"
768,"homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it."
768,I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master’s scorn of the
768,"child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,"
768,because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.
768,
768,"“Cannot ate it?” repeated he, peering in Linton’s face, and subduing"
768,"his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. “But Maister"
768,"Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little ’un; and what wer"
768,"gooid eneugh for him’s gooid eneugh for ye, I’s rayther think!”"
768,
768,"“I _sha’n’t_ eat it!” answered Linton, snappishly. “Take it away.”"
768,
768,"Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us."
768,
768,"“Is there aught ails th’ victuals?” he asked, thrusting the tray under"
768,Heathcliff’s nose.
768,
768,“What should ail them?” he said.
768,
768,"“Wah!” answered Joseph, “yon dainty chap says he cannut ate ’em. But I"
768,guess it’s raight! His mother wer just soa—we wer a’most too mucky to
768,sow t’ corn for makking her breead.”
768,
768,"“Don’t mention his mother to me,” said the master, angrily. “Get him"
768,"something that he can eat, that’s all. What is his usual food, Nelly?”"
768,
768,I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received
768,"instructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father’s"
768,selfishness may contribute to his comfort. He perceives his delicate
768,"constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I’ll console"
768,Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff’s humour has
768,"taken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while"
768,Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly
768,sheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed
768,"the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words—"
768,
768,“Don’t leave me! I’ll not stay here! I’ll not stay here!”
768,
768,Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come
768,"forth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief"
768,guardianship ended.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXI
768,
768,
768,"We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee,"
768,"eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations"
768,followed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to
768,"soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however,"
768,“if I can get him”; and there were no hopes of that. This promise
768,poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at
768,"intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before"
768,she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that
768,she did not recognise him.
768,
768,"When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in"
768,"paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master"
768,"got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was"
768,never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak
768,"health, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to"
768,"dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to"
768,"conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could"
768,not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes
768,together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his
768,lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the
768,parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting
768,"coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort."
768,
768,"“And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,” added the woman; “nor"
768,"one so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open"
768,"a bit late in the evening. Oh! it’s killing, a breath of night air! And"
768,he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph’s bacca-pipe is
768,"poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,"
768,milk for ever—heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;
768,"and there he’ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the"
768,"fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and"
768,"if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him—Hareton is not bad-natured,"
768,"though he’s rough—they’re sure to part, one swearing and the other"
768,crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw’s thrashing him to a
768,"mummy, if he were not his son; and I’m certain he would be fit to turn"
768,"him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But"
768,then he won’t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the
768,"parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he"
768,sends him upstairs directly.”
768,
768,"I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered"
768,"young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so"
768,"originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still"
768,"I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had"
768,been left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he
768,"thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk"
768,to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever
768,"came into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback,"
768,accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite
768,"knocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if"
768,"I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did"
768,"not know, was her successor; she lives there still."
768,
768,Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy
768,reached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested
768,"any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late"
768,mistress’s death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the
768,"library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he"
768,would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine
768,was thrown on her own resources for amusement. This twentieth of March
768,"was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young"
768,"lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a"
768,"ramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave,"
768,if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.
768,
768,"“So make haste, Ellen!” she cried. “I know where I wish to go; where a"
768,colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made
768,their nests yet.”
768,
768,"“That must be a good distance up,” I answered; “they don’t breed on the"
768,edge of the moor.”
768,
768,"“No, it’s not,” she said. “I’ve gone very near with papa.”"
768,
768,"I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the"
768,"matter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off"
768,"again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of"
768,"entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and"
768,"enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my"
768,"delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright"
768,"cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes"
768,"radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an"
768,"angel, in those days. It’s a pity she could not be content."
768,
768,"“Well,” said I, “where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at"
768,them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.”
768,
768,"“Oh, a little further—only a little further, Ellen,” was her answer,"
768,"continually. “Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time"
768,you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.”
768,
768,"But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at"
768,"length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our"
768,"steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she"
768,"either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I"
768,"was compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I"
768,"came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights"
768,"than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of"
768,whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.
768,
768,"Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting"
768,"out the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff’s land, and he"
768,was reproving the poacher.
768,
768,"“I’ve neither taken any nor found any,” she said, as I toiled to them,"
768,expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. “I didn’t mean
768,"to take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I"
768,wished to see the eggs.”
768,
768,"Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his"
768,"acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards"
768,"it, and demanded who “papa” was?"
768,
768,"“Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,” she replied. “I thought you did not"
768,"know me, or you wouldn’t have spoken in that way.”"
768,
768,"“You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?” he said,"
768,sarcastically.
768,
768,"“And what are you?” inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the"
768,speaker. “That man I’ve seen before. Is he your son?”
768,
768,"She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing"
768,but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his
768,age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.
768,
768,"“Miss Cathy,” I interrupted, “it will be three hours instead of one"
768,"that we are out, presently. We really must go back.”"
768,
768,"“No, that man is not my son,” answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside."
768,"“But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your"
768,"nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a"
768,"little rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my"
768,house? You’ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a
768,kind welcome.”
768,
768,"I whispered Catherine that she mustn’t, on any account, accede to the"
768,proposal: it was entirely out of the question.
768,
768,"“Why?” she asked, aloud. “I’m tired of running, and the ground is dewy:"
768,"I can’t sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his"
768,"son. He’s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the"
768,farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don’t you?”
768,
768,"“I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue—it will be a treat for her to look"
768,"in on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me,"
768,Nelly.”
768,
768,"“No, she’s not going to any such place,” I cried, struggling to release"
768,"my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones"
768,"already, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her appointed"
768,"companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,"
768,and vanished.
768,
768,"“Mr. Heathcliff, it’s very wrong,” I continued: “you know you mean no"
768,"good. And there she’ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever"
768,we return; and I shall have the blame.”
768,
768,"“I want her to see Linton,” he answered; “he’s looking better these few"
768,days; it’s not often he’s fit to be seen. And we’ll soon persuade her
768,to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?”
768,
768,"“The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I"
768,suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad
768,"design in encouraging her to do so,” I replied."
768,
768,“My design is as honest as possible. I’ll inform you of its whole
768,"scope,” he said. “That the two cousins may fall in love, and get"
768,married. I’m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no
768,"expectations, and should she second my wishes she’ll be provided for at"
768,once as joint successor with Linton.”
768,
768,"“If Linton died,” I answered, “and his life is quite uncertain,"
768,Catherine would be the heir.”
768,
768,"“No, she would not,” he said. “There is no clause in the will to secure"
768,"it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire"
768,"their union, and am resolved to bring it about.”"
768,
768,"“And I’m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,” I"
768,"returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming."
768,
768,"Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to"
768,"open the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could"
768,not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled
768,"when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I"
768,was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him
768,from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out
768,"walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph"
768,"to bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting"
768,"some months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and"
768,"complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely"
768,temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.
768,
768,"“Now, who is that?” asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. “Can you"
768,tell?”
768,
768,"“Your son?” she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then"
768,the other.
768,
768,"“Yes, yes,” answered he: “but is this the only time you have beheld"
768,"him? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don’t you recall your"
768,"cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?”"
768,
768,"“What, Linton!” cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name."
768,“Is that little Linton? He’s taller than I am! Are you Linton?”
768,
768,"The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him"
768,"fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in"
768,the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her
768,"figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole"
768,aspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton’s looks and movements
768,"were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace"
768,"in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not"
768,"unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his"
768,"cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his"
768,attention between the objects inside and those that lay without:
768,"pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the"
768,former alone.
768,
768,"“And you are my uncle, then!” she cried, reaching up to salute him. “I"
768,"thought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don’t you"
768,visit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close
768,"neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?”"
768,
768,"“I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,” he"
768,"answered. “There—damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to"
768,Linton: they are thrown away on me.”
768,
768,"“Naughty Ellen!” exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her"
768,lavish caresses. “Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But
768,"I’ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and"
768,sometimes bring papa. Won’t you be glad to see us?”
768,
768,"“Of course,” replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,"
768,resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. “But
768,"stay,” he continued, turning towards the young lady. “Now I think of"
768,"it, I’d better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we"
768,"quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if"
768,"you mention coming here to him, he’ll put a veto on your visits"
768,"altogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless"
768,"of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you"
768,must not mention it.”
768,
768,"“Why did you quarrel?” asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen."
768,
768,"“He thought me too poor to wed his sister,” answered Heathcliff, “and"
768,"was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he’ll never forgive"
768,it.”
768,
768,“That’s wrong!” said the young lady: “some time I’ll tell him so. But
768,"Linton and I have no share in your quarrel. I’ll not come here, then;"
768,he shall come to the Grange.”
768,
768,"“It will be too far for me,” murmured her cousin: “to walk four miles"
768,"would kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every"
768,"morning, but once or twice a week.”"
768,
768,The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.
768,
768,"“I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,” he muttered to me. “Miss"
768,"Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send"
768,"him to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!—Do you know that, twenty"
768,"times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I’d have loved"
768,the lad had he been some one else. But I think he’s safe from _her_
768,"love. I’ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir"
768,itself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.
768,"Oh, confound the vapid thing! He’s absorbed in drying his feet, and"
768,never looks at her.—Linton!”
768,
768,"“Yes, father,” answered the boy."
768,
768,"“Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit"
768,"or a weasel’s nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your"
768,shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.”
768,
768,"“Wouldn’t you rather sit here?” asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a"
768,tone which expressed reluctance to move again.
768,
768,"“I don’t know,” she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and"
768,evidently eager to be active.
768,
768,"He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and"
768,"went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for"
768,"Hareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young"
768,"man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks"
768,and his wetted hair.
768,
768,"“Oh, I’ll ask _you_, uncle,” cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the"
768,"housekeeper’s assertion. “That is not my cousin, is he?”"
768,
768,"“Yes,” he replied, “your mother’s nephew. Don’t you like him?”"
768,
768,Catherine looked queer.
768,
768,“Is he not a handsome lad?” he continued.
768,
768,"The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in"
768,Heathcliff’s ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very
768,"sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his"
768,inferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming—
768,
768,"“You’ll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a—What was"
768,"it? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the"
768,"farm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don’t use any bad words; and"
768,"don’t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to"
768,"hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,"
768,"and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as"
768,nicely as you can.”
768,
768,He watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his
768,countenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying
768,the familiar landscape with a stranger’s and an artist’s interest.
768,"Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then"
768,"turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself,"
768,"and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of"
768,conversation.
768,
768,"“I’ve tied his tongue,” observed Heathcliff. “He’ll not venture a"
768,"single syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age—nay,"
768,"some years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ‘gaumless,’ as Joseph"
768,calls it?”
768,
768,"“Worse,” I replied, “because more sullen with it.”"
768,
768,"“I’ve a pleasure in him,” he continued, reflecting aloud. “He has"
768,satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it
768,half so much. But he’s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his
768,"feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for"
768,"instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,"
768,though. And he’ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness
768,and ignorance. I’ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father
768,"secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I’ve"
768,taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don’t
768,"you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?"
768,almost as proud as I am of mine. But there’s this difference; one is
768,"gold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to"
768,ape a service of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I
768,shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.
768,"_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than"
768,"unavailing. _I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any,"
768,"but I, are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of"
768,me! You’ll own that I’ve outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain
768,"could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring’s wrongs, I"
768,"should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again,"
768,indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the
768,world!”
768,
768,"Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply,"
768,"because I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who"
768,"sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms"
768,"of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat"
768,of Catherine’s society for fear of a little fatigue. His father
768,"remarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand"
768,irresolutely extended towards his cap.
768,
768,"“Get up, you idle boy!” he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. “Away"
768,"after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.”"
768,
768,"Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was"
768,"open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable"
768,"attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up,"
768,and scratched his head like a true clown.
768,
768,"“It’s some damnable writing,” he answered. “I cannot read it.”"
768,
768,“Can’t read it?” cried Catherine; “I can read it: it’s English. But I
768,want to know why it is there.”
768,
768,Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.
768,
768,"“He does not know his letters,” he said to his cousin. “Could you"
768,believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?”
768,
768,"“Is he all as he should be?” asked Miss Cathy, seriously; “or is he"
768,"simple: not right? I’ve questioned him twice now, and each time he"
768,looked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly
768,"understand _him_, I’m sure!”"
768,
768,"Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who"
768,certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.
768,
768,"“There’s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?” he said."
768,“My cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the
768,"consequence of scorning ‘book-larning,’ as you would say. Have you"
768,"noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?”"
768,
768,"“Why, where the devil is the use on’t?” growled Hareton, more ready in"
768,"answering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the"
768,two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being
768,delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of
768,amusement.
768,
768,“Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?” tittered Linton.
768,"“Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can’t open your mouth"
768,"without one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!”"
768,
768,"“If thou weren’t more a lass than a lad, I’d fell thee this minute, I"
768,"would; pitiful lath of a crater!” retorted the angry boor, retreating,"
768,while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was
768,"conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it."
768,
768,"Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled"
768,when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular
768,"aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway:"
768,the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton’s faults and
768,"deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl"
768,"relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the"
768,"ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate"
768,"Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap."
768,
768,We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but
768,"happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant"
768,"of our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have"
768,enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted:
768,but she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.
768,
768,"“Aha!” she cried, “you take papa’s side, Ellen: you are partial I know;"
768,or else you wouldn’t have cheated me so many years into the notion that
768,Linton lived a long way from here. I’m really extremely angry; only I’m
768,so pleased I can’t show it! But you must hold your tongue about my
768,"uncle; he’s _my_ uncle, remember; and I’ll scold papa for quarrelling"
768,with him.”
768,
768,"And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of"
768,"her mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did"
768,"not see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and"
768,still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and
768,warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too
768,timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun
768,"connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good"
768,reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.
768,
768,"“Papa!” she exclaimed, after the morning’s salutations, “guess whom I"
768,"saw yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you’ve"
768,"not done right, have you, now? I saw—but listen, and you shall hear how"
768,"I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet"
768,"pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always"
768,disappointed about Linton’s coming back!”
768,
768,She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and
768,"my master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said"
768,"nothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if"
768,she knew why he had concealed Linton’s near neighbourhood from her?
768,Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly
768,enjoy?
768,
768,"“It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,” she answered."
768,
768,"“Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?”"
768,"he said. “No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because"
768,"Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to"
768,"wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest"
768,opportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with
768,your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he
768,"would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else,"
768,I took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to
768,"explain this some time as you grew older, and I’m sorry I delayed it.”"
768,
768,"“But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,” observed Catherine, not"
768,at all convinced; “and _he_ didn’t object to our seeing each other: he
768,said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell
768,"you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for"
768,marrying aunt Isabella. And you won’t. _You_ are the one to be blamed:
768,"he is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you"
768,are not.”
768,
768,"My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her"
768,"uncle-in-law’s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to"
768,"Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his"
768,property. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for
768,"though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and"
768,detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since
768,"Mrs. Linton’s death. “She might have been living yet, if it had not"
768,"been for him!” was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,"
768,Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy—conversant with no bad deeds
768,"except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion,"
768,"arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day"
768,they were committed—was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could
768,"brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its"
768,plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed
768,and shocked at this new view of human nature—excluded from all her
768,studies and all her ideas till now—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary
768,"to pursue the subject. He merely added: “You will know hereafter,"
768,"darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to"
768,"your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.”"
768,
768,"Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a"
768,"couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the"
768,"grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when"
768,"she had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found"
768,"her crying, on her knees by the bedside."
768,
768,"“Oh, fie, silly child!” I exclaimed. “If you had any real griefs you’d"
768,be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had
768,"one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a"
768,"minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the"
768,"world: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such"
768,"an affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have,"
768,instead of coveting more.”
768,
768,"“I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she answered, “it’s for him. He"
768,"expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he’ll be so disappointed:"
768,"and he’ll wait for me, and I sha’n’t come!”"
768,
768,"“Nonsense!” said I, “do you imagine he has thought as much of you as"
768,you have of him? Hasn’t he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a
768,"hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for"
768,"two afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself"
768,no further about you.”
768,
768,"“But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?” she asked,"
768,rising to her feet. “And just send those books I promised to lend him?
768,"His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them"
768,"extremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not,"
768,Ellen?”
768,
768,"“No, indeed! no, indeed!” replied I with decision. “Then he would write"
768,"to you, and there’d never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the"
768,"acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see"
768,that it is done.”
768,
768,"“But how can one little note—?” she recommenced, putting on an"
768,imploring countenance.
768,
768,“Silence!” I interrupted. “We’ll not begin with your little notes. Get
768,into bed.”
768,
768,"She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss"
768,"her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great"
768,"displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there"
768,was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and
768,"a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my"
768,entrance.
768,
768,"“You’ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,” I said, “if you write it;"
768,and at present I shall put out your candle.”
768,
768,"I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my"
768,"hand and a petulant “cross thing!” I then quitted her again, and she"
768,"drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was"
768,finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came
768,from the village; but that I didn’t learn till some time afterwards.
768,"Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew"
768,"wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I"
768,"came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the"
768,"book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose"
768,paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming
768,"down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she"
768,were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in
768,"a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and"
768,whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.
768,
768,"One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings"
768,and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into
768,bits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I
768,"determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as"
768,"soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily"
768,"found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I"
768,"emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to"
768,"examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I"
768,was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of
768,"correspondence—daily almost, it must have been—from Linton Heathcliff:"
768,answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were
768,"embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious"
768,"love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet"
768,with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more
768,experienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds
768,"of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in"
768,"the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied,"
768,incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don’t know; but
768,they appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as
768,"I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,"
768,relocking the vacant drawer.
768,
768,"Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the"
768,"kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain"
768,"little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked"
768,"something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went"
768,"round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought"
768,"valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I"
768,"succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious"
768,"consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall"
768,and perused Miss Cathy’s affectionate composition. It was more simple
768,and more eloquent than her cousin’s: very pretty and very silly. I
768,"shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet,"
768,"she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the"
768,"conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the"
768,"drawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had"
768,"sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain,"
768,keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird
768,"flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping"
768,"young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and"
768,"flutterings, than she by her single “Oh!” and the change that"
768,transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.
768,
768,"“What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?” he said."
768,
768,His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the
768,hoard.
768,
768,"“No, papa!” she gasped. “Ellen! Ellen! come upstairs—I’m sick!”"
768,
768,"I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out."
768,
768,"“Oh, Ellen! you have got them,” she commenced immediately, dropping on"
768,"her knees, when we were enclosed alone. “Oh, give them to me, and I’ll"
768,"never, never do so again! Don’t tell papa. You have not told papa,"
768,"Ellen? say you have not? I’ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won’t do"
768,it any more!”
768,
768,With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.
768,
768,"“So,” I exclaimed, “Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:"
768,you may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in
768,"your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it’s good enough to be printed!"
768,And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before
768,"him? I hav’n’t shown it yet, but you needn’t imagine I shall keep your"
768,ridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing
768,"such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I’m certain.”"
768,
768,"“I didn’t! I didn’t!” sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. “I didn’t"
768,once think of loving him till—”
768,
768,"“_Loving_!” cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word."
768,“_Loving_! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of
768,"loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving,"
768,indeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours
768,in your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I’m going with it to the
768,library; and we’ll see what your father says to such _loving_.”
768,
768,"She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and"
768,then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn
768,them—do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much
768,inclined to laugh as scold—for I esteemed it all girlish vanity—I at
768,"length relented in a measure, and asked,—“If I consent to burn them,"
768,"will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again,"
768,"nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair,"
768,"nor rings, nor playthings?”"
768,
768,"“We don’t send playthings,” cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her"
768,shame.
768,
768,"“Nor anything at all, then, my lady?” I said. “Unless you will, here I"
768,go.”
768,
768,"“I promise, Ellen!” she cried, catching my dress. “Oh, put them in the"
768,"fire, do, do!”"
768,
768,But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was
768,too painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated that I would spare
768,her one or two.
768,
768,"“One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton’s sake!”"
768,
768,"I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an"
768,"angle, and the flame curled up the chimney."
768,
768,"“I will have one, you cruel wretch!” she screamed, darting her hand"
768,"into the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the"
768,expense of her fingers.
768,
768,"“Very well—and I will have some to exhibit to papa!” I answered,"
768,"shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door."
768,
768,"She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to"
768,"finish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and"
768,"interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a"
768,"sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended"
768,to tell my master that the young lady’s qualm of sickness was almost
768,"gone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn’t"
768,"dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and"
768,marvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the
768,"letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, “Master Heathcliff is requested"
768,"to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.”"
768,"And, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets."
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXII
768,
768,
768,"Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but"
768,"the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still"
768,uncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among
768,"the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk,"
768,"and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad"
768,"cold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors"
768,"throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission."
768,
768,"Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably"
768,sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her
768,"reading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship no"
768,"longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,"
768,with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or
768,"three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her"
768,"footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his."
768,
768,"On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November—a fresh watery"
768,"afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered"
768,"leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds—dark grey"
768,"streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain—I"
768,"requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of"
768,"showers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my"
768,umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a
768,formal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited—and that she
768,"invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing"
768,"never known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from"
768,his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. She went
768,"sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind"
768,"might well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my"
768,"eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her"
768,cheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side
768,"of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks,"
768,"with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too"
768,loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly
768,horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these
768,"trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground;"
768,"and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still"
768,considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an
768,"elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending."
768,"From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing"
768,"nothing except singing old songs—my nursery lore—to herself, or"
768,"watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to"
768,"fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming,"
768,happier than words can express.
768,
768,"“Look, Miss!” I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one"
768,twisted tree. “Winter is not here yet. There’s a little flower up
768,"yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those"
768,"turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it"
768,to show to papa?”
768,
768,Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy
768,"shelter, and replied, at length—“No, I’ll not touch it: but it looks"
768,"melancholy, does it not, Ellen?”"
768,
768,"“Yes,” I observed, “about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks"
768,"are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You’re so low, I"
768,daresay I shall keep up with you.”
768,
768,"“No,” she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals"
768,"to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus"
768,"spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever"
768,"and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face."
768,
768,"“Catherine, why are you crying, love?” I asked, approaching and putting"
768,my arm over her shoulder. “You mustn’t cry because papa has a cold; be
768,thankful it is nothing worse.”
768,
768,She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled
768,by sobs.
768,
768,"“Oh, it _will_ be something worse,” she said. “And what shall I do when"
768,"papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can’t forget your words,"
768,"Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary"
768,"the world will be, when papa and you are dead.”"
768,
768,"“None can tell whether you won’t die before us,” I replied. “It’s wrong"
768,to anticipate evil. We’ll hope there are years and years to come before
768,"any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five."
768,"My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr."
768,"Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you"
768,"have counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity"
768,above twenty years beforehand?”
768,
768,"“But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,” she remarked, gazing up with"
768,timid hope to seek further consolation.
768,
768,"“Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,” I replied. “She wasn’t"
768,"as happy as Master: she hadn’t as much to live for. All you need do, is"
768,"to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you"
768,"cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,"
768,Cathy! I’ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and
768,"reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a"
768,person who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to
768,discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it
768,expedient to make.”
768,
768,"“I fret about nothing on earth except papa’s illness,” answered my"
768,companion. “I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I’ll
768,"never—never—oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word"
768,"to vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by"
768,this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would
768,rather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him
768,better than myself.”
768,
768,"“Good words,” I replied. “But deeds must prove it also; and after he is"
768,"well, remember you don’t forget resolutions formed in the hour of"
768,fear.”
768,
768,"As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young"
768,"lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on"
768,"the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed"
768,scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the
768,"highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could"
768,"touch the upper, except from Cathy’s present station. In stretching to"
768,"pull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed"
768,scrambling down to recover it. I bid her be cautious lest she got a
768,"fall, and she nimbly disappeared. But the return was no such easy"
768,"matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes"
768,and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.
768,"I, like a fool, didn’t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and"
768,"exclaiming—“Ellen! you’ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run"
768,round to the porter’s lodge. I can’t scale the ramparts on this side!”
768,
768,"“Stay where you are,” I answered; “I have my bundle of keys in my"
768,"pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I’ll go.”"
768,
768,"Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while"
768,"I tried all the large keys in succession. I had applied the last, and"
768,"found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain"
768,"there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an"
768,approaching sound arrested me. It was the trot of a horse; Cathy’s
768,dance stopped also.
768,
768,“Who is that?” I whispered.
768,
768,"“Ellen, I wish you could open the door,” whispered back my companion,"
768,anxiously.
768,
768,"“Ho, Miss Linton!” cried a deep voice (the rider’s), “I’m glad to meet"
768,"you. Don’t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and"
768,obtain.”
768,
768,"“I sha’n’t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,” answered Catherine. “Papa"
768,"says you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says"
768,the same.”
768,
768,"“That is nothing to the purpose,” said Heathcliff. (He it was.) “I"
768,"don’t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand"
768,your attention. Yes; you have cause to blush. Two or three months
768,"since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in"
768,"play, eh? You deserved, both of you, flogging for that! You especially,"
768,"the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out. I’ve got your letters,"
768,and if you give me any pertness I’ll send them to your father. I
768,"presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn’t you?"
768,"Well, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond. He was in"
768,"earnest: in love, really. As true as I live, he’s dying for you;"
768,"breaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually."
768,"Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have"
768,"used more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his"
768,"idiocy, he gets worse daily; and he’ll be under the sod before summer,"
768,unless you restore him!”
768,
768,“How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?” I called from the
768,inside. “Pray ride on! How can you deliberately get up such paltry
768,"falsehoods? Miss Cathy, I’ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won’t"
768,believe that vile nonsense. You can feel in yourself it is impossible
768,that a person should die for love of a stranger.”
768,
768,"“I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,” muttered the detected"
768,"villain. “Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don’t like your"
768,"double-dealing,” he added aloud. “How could _you_ lie so glaringly as"
768,to affirm I hated the ‘poor child’? and invent bugbear stories to
768,terrify her from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms
768,"me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I"
768,"have not spoken truth: do, there’s a darling! Just imagine your father"
768,"in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your"
768,"careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your"
768,"father himself entreated him; and don’t, from pure stupidity, fall into"
768,"the same error. I swear, on my salvation, he’s going to his grave, and"
768,none but you can save him!”
768,
768,The lock gave way and I issued out.
768,
768,"“I swear Linton is dying,” repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me."
768,"“And grief and disappointment are hastening his death. Nelly, if you"
768,"won’t let her go, you can walk over yourself. But I shall not return"
768,till this time next week; and I think your master himself would
768,scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.”
768,
768,"“Come in,” said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to"
768,"re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of"
768,"the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit."
768,
768,"He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed—"
768,
768,"“Miss Catherine, I’ll own to you that I have little patience with"
768,Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have less. I’ll own that he’s with a
768,"harsh set. He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from"
768,you would be his best medicine. Don’t mind Mrs. Dean’s cruel cautions;
768,"but be generous, and contrive to see him. He dreams of you day and"
768,"night, and cannot be persuaded that you don’t hate him, since you"
768,neither write nor call.”
768,
768,"I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in"
768,"holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for"
768,"the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and"
768,warned us to avoid delay. Our hurry prevented any comment on the
768,"encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined"
768,instinctively that Catherine’s heart was clouded now in double
768,"darkness. Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she"
768,evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.
768,
768,The master had retired to rest before we came in. Cathy stole to his
768,"room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep. She returned, and"
768,asked me to sit with her in the library. We took our tea together; and
768,"afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she"
768,"was weary. I got a book, and pretended to read. As soon as she supposed"
768,"me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it"
768,"appeared, at present, her favourite diversion. I suffered her to enjoy"
768,it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.
768,"Heathcliff’s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would"
768,coincide. Alas! I hadn’t skill to counteract the effect his account had
768,produced: it was just what he intended.
768,
768,"“You may be right, Ellen,” she answered; “but I shall never feel at"
768,ease till I know. And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I
768,"don’t write, and convince him that I shall not change.”"
768,
768,What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity? We
768,parted that night—hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to
768,"Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress’s pony. I"
768,"couldn’t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected"
768,"countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that"
768,"Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the"
768,tale was founded on fact.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXIII
768,
768,
768,"The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning—half frost, half"
768,drizzle—and temporary brooks crossed our path—gurgling from the
768,uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly
768,the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We
768,"entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr."
768,Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own
768,affirmation.
768,
768,"Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring"
768,"fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces"
768,"of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine"
768,ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My
768,"question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had"
768,"grown deaf, and repeated it louder."
768,
768,"“Na—ay!” he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose. “Na—ay! yah"
768,muh goa back whear yah coom frough.”
768,
768,"“Joseph!” cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner"
768,room. “How often am I to call you? There are only a few red ashes now.
768,Joseph! come this moment.”
768,
768,"Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no"
768,ear for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one
768,"gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew"
768,"Linton’s tones, and entered."
768,
768,"“Oh, I hope you’ll die in a garret, starved to death!” said the boy,"
768,mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.
768,
768,He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.
768,
768,"“Is that you, Miss Linton?” he said, raising his head from the arm of"
768,"the great chair, in which he reclined. “No—don’t kiss me: it takes my"
768,"breath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,” continued he, after"
768,recovering a little from Catherine’s embrace; while she stood by
768,"looking very contrite. “Will you shut the door, if you please? you left"
768,it open; and those—those _detestable_ creatures won’t bring coals to
768,the fire. It’s so cold!”
768,
768,"I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid"
768,"complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough,"
768,"and looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper."
768,
768,"“Well, Linton,” murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,"
768,“are you glad to see me? Can I do you any good?”
768,
768,"“Why didn’t you come before?” he asked. “You should have come, instead"
768,of writing. It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters. I’d far
768,"rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor"
768,anything else. I wonder where Zillah is! Will you” (looking at me)
768,“step into the kitchen and see?”
768,
768,I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to
768,"run to and fro at his behest, I replied—"
768,
768,“Nobody is out there but Joseph.”
768,
768,"“I want to drink,” he exclaimed fretfully, turning away. “Zillah is"
768,constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it’s miserable!
768,And I’m obliged to come down here—they resolved never to hear me
768,upstairs.”
768,
768,"“Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?” I asked,"
768,perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.
768,
768,"“Attentive? He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least,” he"
768,"cried. “The wretches! Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton"
768,"laughs at me! I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious"
768,beings.”
768,
768,Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the
768,"dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it. He bid her add a spoonful of"
768,"wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,"
768,"appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind."
768,
768,"“And are you glad to see me?” asked she, reiterating her former"
768,"question, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile."
768,
768,"“Yes, I am. It’s something new to hear a voice like yours!” he replied."
768,"“But I have been vexed, because you wouldn’t come. And papa swore it"
768,"was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;"
768,"and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be"
768,more the master of the Grange than your father by this time. But you
768,"don’t despise me, do you, Miss—?”"
768,
768,"“I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,” interrupted my young lady."
768,"“Despise you? No! Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than"
768,"anybody living. I don’t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not"
768,come when he returns: will he stay away many days?”
768,
768,"“Not many,” answered Linton; “but he goes on to the moors frequently,"
768,since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two
768,with me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be
768,"peevish with you: you’d not provoke me, and you’d always be ready to"
768,"help me, wouldn’t you?”"
768,
768,"“Yes,” said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, “if I could only"
768,"get papa’s consent, I’d spend half my time with you. Pretty Linton! I"
768,wish you were my brother.”
768,
768,"“And then you would like me as well as your father?” observed he, more"
768,cheerfully. “But papa says you would love me better than him and all
768,"the world, if you were my wife; so I’d rather you were that.”"
768,
768,"“No, I should never love anybody better than papa,” she returned"
768,"gravely. “And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters"
768,"and brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and"
768,papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.”
768,
768,Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed
768,"they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father’s aversion to"
768,her aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn’t
768,"succeed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much"
768,"irritated, asserted her relation was false."
768,
768,"“Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,” she answered pertly."
768,
768,“_My_ papa scorns yours!” cried Linton. “He calls him a sneaking fool.”
768,
768,"“Yours is a wicked man,” retorted Catherine; “and you are very naughty"
768,to dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt
768,Isabella leave him as she did.”
768,
768,"“She didn’t leave him,” said the boy; “you sha’n’t contradict me.”"
768,
768,"“She did,” cried my young lady."
768,
768,"“Well, I’ll tell _you_ something!” said Linton. “Your mother hated your"
768,father: now then.”
768,
768,"“Oh!” exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue."
768,
768,"“And she loved mine,” added he."
768,
768,"“You little liar! I hate you now!” she panted, and her face grew red"
768,with passion.
768,
768,"“She did! she did!” sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,"
768,and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other
768,"disputant, who stood behind."
768,
768,"“Hush, Master Heathcliff!” I said; “that’s your father’s tale, too, I"
768,suppose.”
768,
768,"“It isn’t: you hold your tongue!” he answered. “She did, she did,"
768,"Catherine! she did, she did!”"
768,
768,"Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to"
768,fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough
768,that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even
768,"me. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the"
768,mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit
768,"exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down"
768,"silently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat"
768,"opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire."
768,
768,"“How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired, after waiting ten"
768,minutes.
768,
768,"“I wish _she_ felt as I do,” he replied: “spiteful, cruel thing!"
768,Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was
768,better to-day: and there—” his voice died in a whimper.
768,
768,"“_I_ didn’t strike you!” muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent"
768,another burst of emotion.
768,
768,"He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for"
768,"a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for"
768,whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and
768,pathos into the inflexions of his voice.
768,
768,"“I’m sorry I hurt you, Linton,” she said at length, racked beyond"
768,"endurance. “But _I_ couldn’t have been hurt by that little push, and I"
768,"had no idea that you could, either: you’re not much, are you, Linton?"
768,Don’t let me go home thinking I’ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.”
768,
768,"“I can’t speak to you,” he murmured; “you’ve hurt me so that I shall"
768,lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you’d know
768,"what it was; but _you’ll_ be comfortably asleep while I’m in agony, and"
768,nobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful
768,"nights!” And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself."
768,
768,"“Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,” I said, “it"
768,won’t be Miss who spoils your ease: you’d be the same had she never
768,"come. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you’ll get"
768,quieter when we leave you.”
768,
768,"“Must I go?” asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. “Do you want"
768,"me to go, Linton?”"
768,
768,"“You can’t alter what you’ve done,” he replied pettishly, shrinking"
768,"from her, “unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a"
768,fever.”
768,
768,"“Well, then, I must go?” she repeated."
768,
768,"“Let me alone, at least,” said he; “I can’t bear your talking.”"
768,
768,"She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome"
768,"while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a"
768,"movement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream."
768,"Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing"
768,"in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined"
768,to be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his
768,"disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to"
768,"attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,"
768,"knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet"
768,from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.
768,
768,"“I shall lift him on to the settle,” I said, “and he may roll about as"
768,"he pleases: we can’t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss"
768,"Cathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his"
768,"condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then,"
768,there he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care
768,"for his nonsense, he’ll be glad to lie still.”"
768,
768,"She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he"
768,"rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a"
768,stone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.
768,
768,"“I can’t do with that,” he said; “it’s not high enough.”"
768,
768,Catherine brought another to lay above it.
768,
768,"“That’s _too_ high,” murmured the provoking thing."
768,
768,"“How must I arrange it, then?” she asked despairingly."
768,
768,"He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and"
768,converted her shoulder into a support.
768,
768,"“No, that won’t do,” I said. “You’ll be content with the cushion,"
768,Master Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we
768,cannot remain five minutes longer.”
768,
768,"“Yes, yes, we can!” replied Cathy. “He’s good and patient now. He’s"
768,beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will
768,"to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare"
768,"not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn’t come, if"
768,I have hurt you.”
768,
768,"“You must come, to cure me,” he answered. “You ought to come, because"
768,you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when
768,you entered as I am at present—was I?”
768,
768,“But you’ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.—I
768,"didn’t do it all,” said his cousin. “However, we’ll be friends now. And"
768,"you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?”"
768,
768,"“I told you I did,” he replied impatiently. “Sit on the settle and let"
768,"me lean on your knee. That’s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons"
768,"together. Sit quite still and don’t talk: but you may sing a song, if"
768,you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad—one of
768,"those you promised to teach me; or a story. I’d rather have a ballad,"
768,though: begin.”
768,
768,Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment
768,"pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that"
768,"another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on"
768,"until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,"
768,returning for his dinner.
768,
768,"“And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?” asked young"
768,"Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly."
768,
768,"“No,” I answered, “nor next day neither.” She, however, gave a"
768,"different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped"
768,and whispered in his ear.
768,
768,"“You won’t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!” I commenced, when we were"
768,"out of the house. “You are not dreaming of it, are you?”"
768,
768,She smiled.
768,
768,"“Oh, I’ll take good care,” I continued: “I’ll have that lock mended,"
768,and you can escape by no way else.”
768,
768,"“I can get over the wall,” she said laughing. “The Grange is not a"
768,"prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I’m almost"
768,seventeen: I’m a woman. And I’m certain Linton would recover quickly if
768,"he had me to look after him. I’m older than he is, you know, and wiser:"
768,"less childish, am I not? And he’ll soon do as I direct him, with some"
768,slight coaxing. He’s a pretty little darling when he’s good. I’d make
768,"such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we,"
768,"after we were used to each other? Don’t you like him, Ellen?”"
768,
768,“Like him!” I exclaimed. “The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that
768,"ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,"
768,"he’ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he’ll see spring, indeed. And"
768,small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us
768,"that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious"
768,and selfish he’d be. I’m glad you have no chance of having him for a
768,"husband, Miss Catherine.”"
768,
768,My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his
768,death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.
768,
768,"“He’s younger than I,” she answered, after a protracted pause of"
768,"meditation, “and he ought to live the longest: he will—he must live as"
768,long as I do. He’s as strong now as when he first came into the north;
768,"I’m positive of that. It’s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa"
768,"has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn’t he?”"
768,
768,"“Well, well,” I cried, “after all, we needn’t trouble ourselves; for"
768,"listen, Miss,—and mind, I’ll keep my word,—if you attempt going to"
768,"Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,"
768,"and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be"
768,revived.”
768,
768,"“It has been revived,” muttered Cathy, sulkily."
768,
768,"“Must not be continued, then,” I said."
768,
768,"“We’ll see,” was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to"
768,toil in the rear.
768,
768,We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had
768,"been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no"
768,explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change
768,my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights
768,"had done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and"
768,during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties:
768,"a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am"
768,"thankful to say, since."
768,
768,"My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and"
768,cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is
768,"wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for"
768,complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton’s room she
768,appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement
768,"usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play;"
768,and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a
768,"warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said"
768,"her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I"
768,"generally needed nothing after six o’clock, thus the evening was her"
768,own. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after
768,"tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I"
768,remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender
768,"fingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across"
768,"the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library."
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXIV
768,
768,
768,At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move
768,about the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the
768,"evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We"
768,"were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented,"
768,"rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not"
768,"suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused."
768,"She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about"
768,an hour; then came frequent questions.
768,
768,"“Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn’t you better lie down now? You’ll be"
768,"sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.”"
768,
768,"“No, no, dear, I’m not tired,” I returned, continually."
768,
768,"Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her"
768,"disrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching,"
768,and—
768,
768,"“Ellen, I’m tired.”"
768,
768,"“Give over then and talk,” I answered."
768,
768,"That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till"
768,"eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;"
768,"judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she"
768,inflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient
768,still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a
768,"headache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained"
768,"alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were"
768,"better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs"
768,"in the dark. No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below."
768,The servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar’s
768,"door; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my"
768,"candle, and seated myself in the window."
768,
768,"The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I"
768,"reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk"
768,"about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along"
768,the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its
768,"emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a"
768,"considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds;"
768,"then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and"
768,"reappeared presently, leading Miss’s pony; and there she was, just"
768,"dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily"
768,across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the
768,"casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where"
768,"I awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy"
768,"shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage,"
768,"to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The"
768,surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate
768,"exclamation, and stood fixed."
768,
768,"“My dear Miss Catherine,” I began, too vividly impressed by her recent"
768,"kindness to break into a scold, “where have you been riding out at this"
768,hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where
768,have you been? Speak!”
768,
768,"“To the bottom of the park,” she stammered. “I didn’t tell a tale.”"
768,
768,“And nowhere else?” I demanded.
768,
768,"“No,” was the muttered reply."
768,
768,"“Oh, Catherine!” I cried, sorrowfully. “You know you have been doing"
768,"wrong, or you wouldn’t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That"
768,"does grieve me. I’d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a"
768,deliberate lie.”
768,
768,"She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my"
768,neck.
768,
768,"“Well, Ellen, I’m so afraid of you being angry,” she said. “Promise not"
768,"to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.”"
768,
768,"We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold,"
768,"whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she"
768,commenced—
768,
768,"“I’ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I’ve never missed going a"
768,"day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left"
768,your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every
768,"evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn’t scold _him_"
768,"either, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally"
768,"stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to"
768,amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and
768,"then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there"
768,would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for
768,"I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you"
768,"stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael"
768,"was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got"
768,"possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit"
768,"him, because he was sick, and couldn’t come to the Grange; and how papa"
768,would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the
768,"pony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get"
768,"married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library,"
768,"to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that"
768,satisfied him better.
768,
768,“On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that
768,"is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us"
768,"that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was"
768,"off with his dogs—robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard"
768,afterwards—we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and
768,"gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in"
768,"the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone,"
768,"and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we"
768,"planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn’t"
768,"repeat that, because you would call it silly."
768,
768,"“One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest"
768,manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening
768,"on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming"
768,"dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,"
768,and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That
768,was his most perfect idea of heaven’s happiness: mine was rocking in a
768,"rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds"
768,"flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and"
768,"blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side,"
768,"and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but"
768,close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze;
768,"and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with"
768,joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to
768,sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be
768,only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall
768,"asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to"
768,"grow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the"
768,right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.
768,
768,"“After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its"
768,"smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in,"
768,if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help
768,"us, and we’d have a game at blindman’s-buff; she should try to catch"
768,"us: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn’t: there was no pleasure in"
768,"it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in"
768,"a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores"
768,"and shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have"
768,"the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for"
768,"Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn’t"
768,"like it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed,"
768,"and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his"
768,good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs—_your_
768,"songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me"
768,to come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying
768,"home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet,"
768,"darling cousin, till morning."
768,
768,"“On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly"
768,"that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was"
768,"beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I"
768,"shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what"
768,"delights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and"
768,"was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took"
768,"my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny’s"
768,"neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me"
768,"to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it"
768,"would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, ‘It wouldn’t do mitch"
768,hurt if it did;’ and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half
768,"inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and,"
768,"as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and"
768,"said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: ‘Miss"
768,"Catherine! I can read yon, now.’"
768,
768,"“‘Wonderful,’ I exclaimed. ‘Pray let us hear you—you _are_ grown"
768,clever!’
768,
768,"“He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name—‘Hareton Earnshaw.’"
768,
768,"“‘And the figures?’ I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to"
768,a dead halt.
768,
768,"“‘I cannot tell them yet,’ he answered."
768,
768,"“‘Oh, you dunce!’ I said, laughing heartily at his failure."
768,
768,"“The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl"
768,"gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in"
768,"my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really"
768,"was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity"
768,"and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He"
768,"reddened—I saw that by the moonlight—dropped his hand from the latch,"
768,"and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to"
768,"be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own"
768,name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn’t think the same.”
768,
768,"“Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!” I interrupted. “I shall not scold, but I"
768,don’t like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was
768,"your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how"
768,"improper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy"
768,ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and
768,probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed
768,"of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it"
768,and please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad
768,"breeding. Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be"
768,less rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were;
768,"and I’m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base"
768,Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.”
768,
768,"“Well, Ellen, you won’t cry about it, will you?” she exclaimed,"
768,"surprised at my earnestness. “But wait, and you shall hear if he conned"
768,his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the
768,"brute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to"
768,welcome me.
768,
768,"“‘I’m ill to-night, Catherine, love,’ he said; ‘and you must have all"
768,"the talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you"
768,"wouldn’t break your word, and I’ll make you promise again, before you"
768,go.’
768,
768,"“I knew now that I mustn’t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly"
768,"and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had"
768,brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little
768,"of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open:"
768,"having gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized"
768,"Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat."
768,
768,"“‘Get to thy own room!’ he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with"
768,passion; and his face looked swelled and furious. ‘Take her there if
768,she comes to see thee: thou shalln’t keep me out of this. Begone wi’ ye
768,both!’
768,
768,"“He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him"
768,"into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly"
768,"longing to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one"
768,"volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out. I heard a"
768,"malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious"
768,"Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering."
768,
768,“‘I wer sure he’d sarve ye out! He’s a grand lad! He’s getten t’ raight
768,"sperrit in him! _He_ knaws—ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t’"
768,"maister yonder—Ech, ech, ech! He made ye skift properly! Ech, ech,"
768,ech!’
768,
768,"“‘Where must we go?’ I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old"
768,wretch’s mockery.
768,
768,"“Linton was white and trembling. He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!"
768,he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into
768,"an expression of frantic, powerless fury. He grasped the handle of the"
768,"door, and shook it: it was fastened inside."
768,
768,"“‘If you don’t let me in, I’ll kill you!—If you don’t let me in, I’ll"
768,kill you!’ he rather shrieked than said. ‘Devil! devil!—I’ll kill
768,you—I’ll kill you!’
768,
768,“Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.
768,
768,"“‘Thear, that’s t’ father!’ he cried. ‘That’s father! We’ve allas"
768,"summut o’ either side in us. Niver heed, Hareton, lad—dunnut be"
768,’feard—he cannot get at thee!’
768,
768,"“I took hold of Linton’s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he"
768,shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed. At last his cries were
768,"choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and"
768,"he fell on the ground. I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and"
768,"called for Zillah, as loud as I could. She soon heard me: she was"
768,"milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work,"
768,she inquired what there was to do? I hadn’t breath to explain; dragging
768,"her in, I looked about for Linton. Earnshaw had come out to examine the"
768,"mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing"
768,upstairs. Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top
768,"of the steps, and said I shouldn’t go in: I must go home. I exclaimed"
768,"that he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter. Joseph locked the door,"
768,"and declared I should do ‘no sich stuff,’ and asked me whether I were"
768,‘bahn to be as mad as him.’ I stood crying till the housekeeper
768,"reappeared. She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn’t"
768,"do with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me"
768,into the house.
768,
768,"“Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head! I sobbed and wept so"
768,that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy
768,"with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me ‘wisht,’"
768,"and denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my"
768,"assertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison"
768,"and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide"
768,"his cowardly agitation. Still, I was not rid of him: when at length"
768,"they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the"
768,"premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and"
768,checked Minny and took hold of me.
768,
768,"“‘Miss Catherine, I’m ill grieved,’ he began, ‘but it’s rayther too"
768,bad—’
768,
768,"“I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me. He"
768,"let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more"
768,than half out of my senses.
768,
768,"“I didn’t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn’t go to Wuthering"
768,Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely
768,"excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and"
768,sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton. On the
768,"third day I took courage: at least, I couldn’t bear longer suspense,"
768,"and stole off once more. I went at five o’clock, and walked; fancying I"
768,"might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton’s room,"
768,"unobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach. Zillah"
768,"received me, and saying ‘the lad was mending nicely,’ showed me into a"
768,"small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I"
768,"beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he"
768,"would neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen:"
768,"he has such an unhappy temper. And what quite confounded me, when he"
768,"did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned"
768,"the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame! Unable to reply, except"
768,"passionately, I got up and walked from the room. He sent after me a"
768,faint ‘Catherine!’ He did not reckon on being answered so: but I
768,wouldn’t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed
768,"at home, nearly determined to visit him no more. But it was so"
768,"miserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about"
768,"him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed."
768,It _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong
768,"to refrain. Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said ‘Yes,’"
768,and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills. I was
768,forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use
768,trying to conceal my presence.
768,
768,"“‘Young master is in the house,’ said Zillah, as she saw me making for"
768,"the parlour. I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the"
768,room directly. Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking
768,"up to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be"
768,true—
768,
768,"“‘As you don’t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to"
768,"hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last"
768,meeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no
768,"wish to see me, and that he mustn’t invent any more falsehoods on the"
768,subject.’
768,
768,"“‘Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,’ he answered. ‘You are so"
768,"much happier than I am, you ought to be better. Papa talks enough of my"
768,"defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should"
768,doubt myself. I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he
768,"calls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate"
768,"everybody! I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit,"
768,"almost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you’ll get"
768,"rid of an annoyance. Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that"
768,"if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would"
768,"be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy. And"
768,believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I
768,"deserved your love: and though I couldn’t, and cannot help showing my"
768,"nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent"
768,it till I die!’
768,
768,"“I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though"
768,"we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again. We were"
768,"reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not"
768,entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted
768,"nature. He’ll never let his friends be at ease, and he’ll never be at"
768,"ease himself! I have always gone to his little parlour, since that"
768,night; because his father returned the day after.
768,
768,"“About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were"
768,the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now
768,"with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I’ve"
768,learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the
768,latter. Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at
768,"all. Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him"
768,abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before. I
768,"can’t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened. Linton had certainly"
768,"behaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and"
768,I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff’s lecture by entering and telling him so.
768,"He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that"
768,"view of the matter. Since then, I’ve told Linton he must whisper his"
768,"bitter things. Now, Ellen, you have heard all. I can’t be prevented"
768,"from going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two"
768,"people; whereas, if you’ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb"
768,"the tranquillity of none. You’ll not tell, will you? It will be very"
768,"heartless, if you do.”"
768,
768,"“I’ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,” I"
768,"replied. “It requires some study; and so I’ll leave you to your rest,"
768,and go think it over.”
768,
768,"I thought it over aloud, in my master’s presence; walking straight from"
768,"her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of"
768,"her conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton. Mr."
768,"Linton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to"
768,"me. In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and"
768,she learnt also that her secret visits were to end. In vain she wept
768,"and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity"
768,on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write
768,and give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but
768,explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering
768,"Heights. Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew’s disposition and"
768,"state of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight"
768,consolation.

768,CHAPTER XXV
768,
768,
768,"“These things happened last winter, sir,” said Mrs. Dean; “hardly more"
768,"than a year ago. Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve"
768,"months’ end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating"
768,"them! Yet, who knows how long you’ll be a stranger? You’re too young to"
768,"rest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one"
768,could see Catherine Linton and not love her. You smile; but why do you
768,look so lively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you
768,asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace? and why—?”
768,
768,"“Stop, my good friend!” I cried. “It may be very possible that _I_"
768,should love her; but would she love me? I doubt it too much to venture
768,my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not
768,"here. I’m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return. Go on. Was"
768,Catherine obedient to her father’s commands?”
768,
768,"“She was,” continued the housekeeper. “Her affection for him was still"
768,the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke
768,in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils
768,"and foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he"
768,"could bequeath to guide her. He said to me, a few days afterwards, ‘I"
768,"wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call. Tell me, sincerely, what"
768,"you think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect"
768,"of improvement, as he grows a man?’"
768,
768,"“‘He’s very delicate, sir,’ I replied; ‘and scarcely likely to reach"
768,"manhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if"
768,"Miss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond"
768,her control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.
768,"However, master, you’ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him"
768,and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his
768,being of age.’”
768,
768,"Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton"
768,"Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and"
768,"we could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the"
768,sparely-scattered gravestones.
768,
768,"“I’ve prayed often,” he half soliloquised, “for the approach of what is"
768,"coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it. I thought the memory of"
768,the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than
768,"the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks,"
768,"to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow! Ellen, I’ve been very"
768,happy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she
768,was a living hope at my side. But I’ve been as happy musing by myself
768,"among those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June"
768,"evenings, on the green mound of her mother’s grave, and"
768,wishing—yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it. What can I
768,do for Cathy? How must I quit her? I’d not care one moment for Linton
768,"being Heathcliff’s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could"
768,"console her for my loss. I’d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends,"
768,and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing! But should Linton be
768,unworthy—only a feeble tool to his father—I cannot abandon her to him!
768,"And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in"
768,"making her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die."
768,"Darling! I’d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before"
768,me.”
768,
768,"“Resign her to God as it is, sir,” I answered, “and if we should lose"
768,"you—which may He forbid—under His providence, I’ll stand her friend and"
768,counsellor to the last. Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don’t fear
768,that she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are
768,always finally rewarded.”
768,
768,"Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he"
768,resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter. To her
768,"inexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and"
768,"then his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt"
768,"sure of his recovering. On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit"
768,"the churchyard: it was raining, and I observed—"
768,
768,"“You’ll surely not go out to-night, sir?”"
768,
768,"He answered,—“No, I’ll defer it this year a little longer.”"
768,
768,"He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and,"
768,"had the invalid been presentable, I’ve no doubt his father would have"
768,"permitted him to come. As it was, being instructed, he returned an"
768,"answer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the"
768,"Grange; but his uncle’s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to"
768,"meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his"
768,cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.
768,
768,"That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own. Heathcliff"
768,"knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine’s company, then."
768,
768,"“I do not ask,” he said, “that she may visit here; but am I never to"
768,"see her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid"
768,"her to come to mine? Do, now and then, ride with her towards the"
768,"Heights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence! We have"
768,done nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me:
768,"you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send"
768,"me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please,"
768,except at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you
768,that my father’s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your
768,nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy
768,"of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also."
768,You inquire after my health—it is better; but while I remain cut off
768,"from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who"
768,"never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?”"
768,
768,"Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his"
768,"request; because he could not accompany Catherine. He said, in summer,"
768,"perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing"
768,"at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was"
768,able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.
768,"Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have"
768,spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations:
768,"but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on"
768,"every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his"
768,"peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly"
768,"uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being"
768,held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr.
768,"Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely"
768,deceiving him with empty promises.
768,
768,Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length
768,persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk
768,"together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors"
768,nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had
768,"set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady’s fortune,"
768,he had a natural desire that she might retain—or at least return in a
768,short time to—the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only
768,prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea
768,"that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one,"
768,"I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master"
768,"Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part,"
768,"began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually"
768,"rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed"
768,so earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father
768,treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards
768,"learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:"
768,his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling
768,plans were threatened with defeat by death.

768,
768,
768,"Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his"
768,"assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first"
768,"ride to join her cousin. It was a close, sultry day: devoid of"
768,"sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our"
768,"place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads."
768,"On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a"
768,"messenger, told us that,—“Maister Linton wer just o’ this side th’"
768,Heights: and he’d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.”
768,
768,"“Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,” I"
768,"observed: “he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at"
768,once.”
768,
768,"“Well, we’ll turn our horses’ heads round when we reach him,” answered"
768,my companion; “our excursion shall lie towards home.”
768,
768,"But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from"
768,"his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,"
768,"and leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach,"
768,and did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so
768,"feebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,—“Why, Master"
768,"Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning. How ill"
768,you do look!”
768,
768,Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the
768,ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation
768,"on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were"
768,worse than usual?
768,
768,"“No—better—better!” he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if"
768,"he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over"
768,her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the
768,languid expression they once possessed.
768,
768,"“But you have been worse,” persisted his cousin; “worse than when I saw"
768,"you last; you are thinner, and—”"
768,
768,"“I’m tired,” he interrupted, hurriedly. “It is too hot for walking, let"
768,"us rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick—papa says I grow"
768,so fast.”
768,
768,"Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her."
768,
768,"“This is something like your paradise,” said she, making an effort at"
768,cheerfulness. “You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the
768,"place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only"
768,there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer
768,"than sunshine. Next week, if you can, we’ll ride down to the Grange"
768,"Park, and try mine.”"
768,
768,Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had
768,evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His
768,"lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity"
768,"to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not"
768,conceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his
768,whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into
768,"fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the"
768,peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be
768,"soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed"
768,"invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured"
768,"mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did,"
768,"that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure"
768,"our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to"
768,"depart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,"
768,and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully
768,"towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at"
768,least.
768,
768,"“But I think,” said Cathy, “you’d be more comfortable at home than"
768,"sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and"
768,"songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;"
768,"you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse"
768,"you, I’d willingly stay.”"
768,
768,"“Stay to rest yourself,” he replied. “And, Catherine, don’t think or"
768,say that I’m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make
768,"me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell"
768,"uncle I’m in tolerable health, will you?”"
768,
768,"“I’ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn’t affirm that you"
768,"are,” observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion"
768,of what was evidently an untruth.
768,
768,"“And be here again next Thursday,” continued he, shunning her puzzled"
768,gaze. “And give him my thanks for permitting you to come—my best
768,"thanks, Catherine. And—and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked"
768,"you about me, don’t lead him to suppose that I’ve been extremely silent"
768,"and stupid: don’t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing—he’ll be"
768,angry.”
768,
768,"“I care nothing for his anger,” exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be"
768,its object.
768,
768,"“But I do,” said her cousin, shuddering. “_Don’t_ provoke him against"
768,"me, Catherine, for he is very hard.”"
768,
768,"“Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired. “Has he grown"
768,"weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?”"
768,
768,"Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by"
768,"his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on"
768,"his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of"
768,"exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for"
768,"bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did"
768,"not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and"
768,annoy.
768,
768,"“Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?” she whispered in my ear, at last. “I"
768,"can’t tell why we should stay. He’s asleep, and papa will be wanting us"
768,back.”
768,
768,"“Well, we must not leave him asleep,” I answered; “wait till he wakes,"
768,"and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to"
768,see poor Linton has soon evaporated!”
768,
768,“Why did _he_ wish to see me?” returned Catherine. “In his crossest
768,"humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious"
768,mood. It’s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform—this
768,interview—for fear his father should scold him. But I’m hardly going to
768,come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for
768,"ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I’m glad he’s"
768,"better in health, I’m sorry he’s so much less pleasant, and so much"
768,less affectionate to me.”
768,
768,"“You think _he is_ better in health, then?” I said."
768,
768,"“Yes,” she answered; “because he always made such a great deal of his"
768,"sufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell"
768,"papa; but he’s better, very likely.”"
768,
768,"“There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,” I remarked; “I should"
768,conjecture him to be far worse.”
768,
768,"Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if"
768,any one had called his name.
768,
768,"“No,” said Catherine; “unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you"
768,"manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.”"
768,
768,"“I thought I heard my father,” he gasped, glancing up to the frowning"
768,nab above us. “You are sure nobody spoke?”
768,
768,"“Quite sure,” replied his cousin. “Only Ellen and I were disputing"
768,"concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we"
768,"separated in winter? If you be, I’m certain one thing is not"
768,"stronger—your regard for me: speak,—are you?”"
768,
768,"The tears gushed from Linton’s eyes as he answered, “Yes, yes, I am!”"
768,"And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up"
768,and down to detect its owner.
768,
768,"Cathy rose. “For to-day we must part,” she said. “And I won’t conceal"
768,that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I’ll
768,mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.
768,Heathcliff.”
768,
768,"“Hush,” murmured Linton; “for God’s sake, hush! He’s coming.” And he"
768,"clung to Catherine’s arm, striving to detain her; but at that"
768,"announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who"
768,obeyed her like a dog.
768,
768,"“I’ll be here next Thursday,” she cried, springing to the saddle."
768,"“Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!”"
768,
768,"And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed"
768,was he in anticipating his father’s approach.
768,
768,"Before we reached home, Catherine’s displeasure softened into a"
768,"perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,"
768,"uneasy doubts about Linton’s actual circumstances, physical and social:"
768,"in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a"
768,second journey would make us better judges. My master requested an
768,account of our ongoings. His nephew’s offering of thanks was duly
768,"delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little"
768,"light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to"
768,reveal.

768,
768,CHAPTER XXVII
768,
768,
768,"Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth"
768,rapid alteration of Edgar Linton’s state. The havoc that months had
768,previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine
768,we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to
768,"delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful"
768,"probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart"
768,"to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,"
768,"and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,"
768,where her father stopped a short time daily—the brief period he could
768,"bear to sit up—and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged"
768,"each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by"
768,"his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my"
768,master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a
768,happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that
768,she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.
768,
768,"He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,"
768,"that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in"
768,mind; for Linton’s letters bore few or no indications of his defective
768,"character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from"
768,correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in
768,disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power
768,nor opportunity to turn to account.
768,
768,We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of
768,"August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed"
768,"whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine’s face was"
768,just like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid
768,"succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more"
768,transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that
768,passing forgetfulness of its cares.
768,
768,We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.
768,"My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to"
768,"stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on"
768,horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn’t risk losing sight of the charge
768,committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.
768,Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:
768,"not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked"
768,more like fear.
768,
768,"“It is late!” he said, speaking short and with difficulty. “Is not your"
768,father very ill? I thought you wouldn’t come.”
768,
768,"“_Why_ won’t you be candid?” cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting."
768,"“Why cannot you say at once you don’t want me? It is strange, Linton,"
768,"that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,"
768,"apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!”"
768,
768,"Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;"
768,but his cousin’s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical
768,behaviour.
768,
768,"“My father _is_ very ill,” she said; “and why am I called from his"
768,"bedside? Why didn’t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you"
768,wished I wouldn’t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and
768,trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can’t dance
768,attendance on your affectations now!”
768,
768,"“My affectations!” he murmured; “what are they? For heaven’s sake,"
768,"Catherine, don’t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am"
768,"a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can’t be scorned enough; but I’m too"
768,"mean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.”"
768,
768,"“Nonsense!” cried Catherine in a passion. “Foolish, silly boy! And"
768,"there! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn’t"
768,"bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your"
768,service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from
768,"the hearth-stone, and pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock!"
768,"If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should"
768,"spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,"
768,and don’t degrade yourself into an abject reptile—_don’t_!”
768,
768,"With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his"
768,nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite
768,terror.
768,
768,"“Oh!” he sobbed, “I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I’m a"
768,"traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be"
768,"killed! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said"
768,"you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn’t harm you. You’ll not go,"
768,"then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent—and"
768,he’ll let me die with you!”
768,
768,"My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him."
768,"The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she"
768,grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.
768,
768,“Consent to what?” she asked. “To stay! tell me the meaning of this
768,"strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract"
768,"me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your"
768,"heart. You wouldn’t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn’t let any"
768,"enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I’ll believe you are a coward,"
768,"for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.”"
768,
768,"“But my father threatened me,” gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated"
768,"fingers, “and I dread him—I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!”"
768,
768,"“Oh, well!” said Catherine, with scornful compassion, “keep your"
768,secret: _I’m_ no coward. Save yourself: I’m not afraid!”
768,
768,"Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her"
768,"supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was"
768,"cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should"
768,"never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,"
768,"hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff"
768,"almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn’t cast a glance"
768,"towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton’s"
768,sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed
768,"to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn’t avoid doubting,"
768,he said—
768,
768,"“It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at"
768,"the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,” he added, in a lower tone,"
768,“that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his
768,illness?”
768,
768,"“No; my master is dying,” I replied: “it is true enough. A sad thing it"
768,"will be for us all, but a blessing for him!”"
768,
768,"“How long will he last, do you think?” he asked."
768,
768,"“I don’t know,” I said."
768,
768,"“Because,” he continued, looking at the two young people, who were"
768,fixed under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir
768,"or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his"
768,account—“because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I’d
768,"thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp"
768,been playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about
768,snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?”
768,
768,"“Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress,” I answered. “To see"
768,"him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the"
768,"hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.”"
768,
768,"“He shall be, in a day or two,” muttered Heathcliff. “But first—get up,"
768,"Linton! Get up!” he shouted. “Don’t grovel on the ground there: up,"
768,this moment!”
768,
768,"Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,"
768,"caused by his father’s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing"
768,"else to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but"
768,"his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back"
768,"again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean"
768,against a ridge of turf.
768,
768,"“Now,” said he, with curbed ferocity, “I’m getting angry—and if you"
768,don’t command that paltry spirit of yours—_damn_ you! get up directly!”
768,
768,"“I will, father,” he panted. “Only, let me alone, or I shall faint."
768,"I’ve done as you wished, I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that"
768,"I—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.”"
768,
768,"“Take mine,” said his father; “stand on your feet. There now—she’ll"
768,"lend you her arm: that’s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was"
768,"the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to"
768,"walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.”"
768,
768,"“Linton dear!” whispered Catherine, “I can’t go to Wuthering Heights:"
768,papa has forbidden me. He’ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?”
768,
768,"“I can never re-enter that house,” he answered. “I’m _not_ to re-enter"
768,it without you!”
768,
768,“Stop!” cried his father. “We’ll respect Catherine’s filial scruples.
768,"Nelly, take him in, and I’ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,"
768,without delay.”
768,
768,"“You’ll do well,” replied I. “But I must remain with my mistress: to"
768,mind your son is not my business.”
768,
768,"“You are very stiff,” said Heathcliff, “I know that: but you’ll force"
768,me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.
768,"Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?”"
768,
768,"He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile"
768,"being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored"
768,"her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no"
768,"denial. However I disapproved, I couldn’t hinder her: indeed, how could"
768,she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no
768,"means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and"
768,any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the
768,"threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had"
768,"conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when"
768,"Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed—“My house is not stricken"
768,"with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit"
768,"down, and allow me to shut the door.”"
768,
768,He shut and locked it also. I started.
768,
768,"“You shall have tea before you go home,” he added. “I am by myself."
768,"Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are"
768,"off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I’m used to being alone, I’d"
768,"rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton,"
768,take your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly
768,"worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I"
768,mean. How she does stare! It’s odd what a savage feeling I have to
768,anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less
768,"strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow"
768,"vivisection of those two, as an evening’s amusement.”"
768,
768,"He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, “By"
768,hell! I hate them.”
768,
768,"“I am not afraid of you!” exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the"
768,latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes
768,flashing with passion and resolution. “Give me that key: I will have
768,"it!” she said. “I wouldn’t eat or drink here, if I were starving.”"
768,
768,Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He
768,"looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,"
768,"possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom"
768,"she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in"
768,getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to
768,the present; he recovered it speedily.
768,
768,"“Now, Catherine Linton,” he said, “stand off, or I shall knock you"
768,down; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.”
768,
768,"Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its"
768,"contents again. “We _will_ go!” she repeated, exerting her utmost"
768,efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails
768,"made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff"
768,glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.
768,Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened
768,"them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had"
768,"well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling"
768,"her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps"
768,"on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his"
768,"threat, had she been able to fall."
768,
768,At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. “You villain!” I
768,"began to cry, “you villain!” A touch on the chest silenced me: I am"
768,"stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I"
768,"staggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a"
768,"blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,"
768,"put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not"
768,"sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor"
768,"thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered."
768,
768,"“I know how to chastise children, you see,” said the scoundrel, grimly,"
768,"as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the"
768,"floor. “Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall"
768,"be your father, to-morrow—all the father you’ll have in a few days—and"
768,you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you’re no weakling:
768,"you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in"
768,your eyes again!”
768,
768,"Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning"
768,"cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of"
768,"the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,"
768,"that the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff,"
768,"perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea"
768,"himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and"
768,handed me a cup.
768,
768,"“Wash away your spleen,” he said. “And help your own naughty pet and"
768,"mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I’m going out to seek"
768,your horses.”
768,
768,"Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We"
768,"tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the"
768,windows—they were too narrow for even Cathy’s little figure.
768,
768,"“Master Linton,” I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, “you"
768,"know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or"
768,"I’ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin’s.”"
768,
768,"“Yes, Linton, you must tell,” said Catherine. “It was for your sake I"
768,came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.”
768,
768,"“Give me some tea, I’m thirsty, and then I’ll tell you,” he answered."
768,"“Mrs. Dean, go away. I don’t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,"
768,you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won’t drink that. Give
768,me another.”
768,
768,"Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted"
768,"at the little wretch’s composure, since he was no longer in terror for"
768,himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as
768,ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced
768,with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;
768,"and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears."
768,
768,"“Papa wants us to be married,” he continued, after sipping some of the"
768,liquid. “And he knows your papa wouldn’t let us marry now; and he’s
768,"afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,"
768,"and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you"
768,"shall return home next day, and take me with you.”"
768,
768,"“Take you with her, pitiful changeling!” I exclaimed. “_You_ marry?"
768,"Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you"
768,"imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie"
768,herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the
768,"notion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you"
768,"for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with"
768,"your dastardly puling tricks: and—don’t look so silly, now! I’ve a very"
768,"good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and"
768,your imbecile conceit.”
768,
768,"I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he"
768,"took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine"
768,rebuked me.
768,
768,"“Stay all night? No,” she said, looking slowly round. “Ellen, I’ll burn"
768,that door down but I’ll get out.”
768,
768,"And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but"
768,Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his
768,"two feeble arms sobbing:—“Won’t you have me, and save me? not let me"
768,"come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn’t go and leave,"
768,after all. You _must_ obey my father—you _must_!”
768,
768,"“I must obey my own,” she replied, “and relieve him from this cruel"
768,suspense. The whole night! What would he think? He’ll be distressed
768,already. I’ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!
768,"You’re in no danger; but if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better"
768,than you!”
768,
768,The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff’s anger restored to the boy
768,"his coward’s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she"
768,"persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,"
768,persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus
768,"occupied, our jailor re-entered."
768,
768,"“Your beasts have trotted off,” he said, “and—now Linton! snivelling"
768,"again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and get to"
768,"bed. In a month or two, my lad, you’ll be able to pay her back her"
768,"present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You’re pining for pure love,"
768,"are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There,"
768,to bed! Zillah won’t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!
768,"hold your noise! Once in your own room, I’ll not come near you: you"
768,"needn’t fear. By chance, you’ve managed tolerably. I’ll look to the"
768,rest.”
768,
768,"He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and"
768,the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected
768,the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock
768,"was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I"
768,"stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to"
768,her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else
768,"would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,"
768,but he scowled on her and muttered—“Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your
768,courage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!”
768,
768,"“I _am_ afraid now,” she replied, “because, if I stay, papa will be"
768,miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when
768,"he—Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa"
768,would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do
768,what I’ll willingly do of myself?”
768,
768,"“Let him dare to force you,” I cried. “There’s law in the land, thank"
768,God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I’d inform if
768,he were my own son: and it’s felony without benefit of clergy!”
768,
768,“Silence!” said the ruffian. “To the devil with your clamour! I don’t
768,"want _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in"
768,thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for
768,satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your
768,residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing
768,"me that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,"
768,I’ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place
768,till it is fulfilled.”
768,
768,"“Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I’m safe!” exclaimed Catherine,"
768,"weeping bitterly. “Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he’ll think we’re"
768,lost. What shall we do?”
768,
768,"“Not he! He’ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a"
768,"little amusement,” answered Heathcliff. “You cannot deny that you"
768,"entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to"
768,the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement
768,"at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that"
768,"man _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when"
768,"your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world"
768,"(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went"
768,out of it. I’d join him. I don’t love you! How should I? Weep away. As
768,"far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless"
768,Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears
768,to fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me
768,vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and
768,kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind—that’s paternal. But
768,Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.
768,Linton can play the little tyrant well. He’ll undertake to torture any
768,"number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You’ll"
768,"be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get"
768,"home again, I assure you.”"
768,
768,“You’re right there!” I said; “explain your son’s character. Show his
768,"resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice"
768,before she takes the cockatrice!”
768,
768,"“I don’t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,” he answered;"
768,"“because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along"
768,"with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite"
768,"concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and"
768,you’ll have an opportunity of judging!”
768,
768,"“I’ll not retract my word,” said Catherine. “I’ll marry him within this"
768,"hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,"
768,"you’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from _mere_"
768,"malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had"
768,"left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to"
768,"live? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your"
768,"knee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face"
768,"till you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! _do_ look! you’ll see"
768,nothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck
768,"me. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?"
768,"Ah! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and"
768,pitying me.”
768,
768,"“Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!” cried"
768,"Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. “I’d rather be hugged by a snake."
768,How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!”
768,
768,"He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept"
768,"with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my"
768,"mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered"
768,"dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be"
768,shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was
768,growing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host
768,hurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There
768,"was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone."
768,
768,"“I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,” I observed to Catherine."
768,“I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?”
768,
768,"“It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,” said"
768,"Heathcliff, overhearing me. “You should have opened a lattice and"
768,called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn’t. She’s glad
768,"to be obliged to stay, I’m certain.”"
768,
768,"At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief"
768,without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o’clock. Then
768,"he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah’s chamber; and I"
768,whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get
768,"through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight."
768,"The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap"
768,was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We
768,"neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and"
768,watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I
768,could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I
768,"seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment"
768,"on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the"
768,"misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I"
768,"am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I"
768,thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.
768,
768,"At seven o’clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She"
768,"ran to the door immediately, and answered, “Yes.” “Here, then,” he"
768,"said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned"
768,the lock again. I demanded my release.
768,
768,"“Be patient,” he replied; “I’ll send up your breakfast in a while.”"
768,
768,"I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine"
768,"asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it"
768,"another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at"
768,"length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff’s."
768,
768,"“I’ve brought you something to eat,” said a voice; “oppen t’ door!”"
768,
768,"Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me"
768,all day.
768,
768,"“Tak’ it,” he added, thrusting the tray into my hand."
768,
768,"“Stay one minute,” I began."
768,
768,"“Nay,” cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour"
768,forth to detain him.
768,
768,"And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next"
768,"night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,"
768,"altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a"
768,"model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving"
768,his sense of justice or compassion.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXVIII
768,
768,
768,"On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step"
768,"approached—lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the"
768,"room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk"
768,"bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm."
768,
768,"“Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!” she exclaimed. “Well! there is a talk about you"
768,at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse
768,"marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you’d been found, and"
768,"he’d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure?"
768,"And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But"
768,"you’re not so thin—you’ve not been so poorly, have you?”"
768,
768,“Your master is a true scoundrel!” I replied. “But he shall answer for
768,it. He needn’t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!”
768,
768,“What do you mean?” asked Zillah. “It’s not his tale: they tell that in
768,the village—about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to
768,"Earnshaw, when I come in—‘Eh, they’s queer things, Mr. Hareton,"
768,"happened since I went off. It’s a sad pity of that likely young lass,"
768,"and cant Nelly Dean.’ He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I"
768,"told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to"
768,"himself, and said, ‘If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,"
768,"Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can"
768,"tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got"
768,"into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed"
768,her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange
768,"at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young"
768,lady will follow in time to attend the squire’s funeral.’”
768,
768,"“Mr. Edgar is not dead?” I gasped. “Oh! Zillah, Zillah!”"
768,
768,"“No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,” she replied; “you’re right"
768,sickly yet. He’s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another
768,day. I met him on the road and asked.”
768,
768,"Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened"
768,"below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for"
768,some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with
768,"sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I"
768,"hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a"
768,"slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,"
768,"sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements"
768,"with apathetic eyes. “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded sternly,"
768,"supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching"
768,"him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent."
768,
768,“Is she gone?” I said.
768,
768,"“No,” he replied; “she’s upstairs: she’s not to go; we won’t let her.”"
768,
768,"“You won’t let her, little idiot!” I exclaimed. “Direct me to her room"
768,"immediately, or I’ll make you sing out sharply.”"
768,
768,"“Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,” he"
768,"answered. “He says I’m not to be soft with Catherine: she’s my wife,"
768,and it’s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates
768,"me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan’t have"
768,"it: and she shan’t go home! She never shall!—she may cry, and be sick"
768,as much as she pleases!”
768,
768,"He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to"
768,drop asleep.
768,
768,"“Master Heathcliff,” I resumed, “have you forgotten all Catherine’s"
768,"kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when"
768,"she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through"
768,"wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you"
768,would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times
768,"too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though"
768,you know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That’s fine
768,"gratitude, is it not?”"
768,
768,"The corner of Linton’s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his"
768,lips.
768,
768,“Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?” I continued.
768,"“Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you"
768,"will have any. And you say she’s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up"
768,there in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so
768,"neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,"
768,"too; but you won’t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you"
768,"see—an elderly woman, and a servant merely—and you, after pretending"
768,"such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every"
768,"tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you’re a"
768,"heartless, selfish boy!”"
768,
768,"“I can’t stay with her,” he answered crossly. “I’ll not stay by myself."
768,"She cries so I can’t bear it. And she won’t give over, though I say"
768,"I’ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle"
768,her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the
768,"room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for"
768,vexation that I couldn’t sleep.”
768,
768,"“Is Mr. Heathcliff out?” I inquired, perceiving that the wretched"
768,creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin’s mental tortures.
768,
768,"“He’s in the court,” he replied, “talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says"
768,"uncle is dying, truly, at last. I’m glad, for I shall be master of the"
768,Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn’t
768,hers! It’s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice
768,"books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and"
768,"her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;"
768,"but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And"
768,"then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I"
768,"should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,"
768,"and on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday—I said"
768,"_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful"
768,"thing wouldn’t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked"
768,"out—that frightens her—she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges"
768,"and divided the case, and gave me her mother’s portrait; the other she"
768,"attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained"
768,"it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;"
768,"she refused, and he—he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,"
768,and crushed it with his foot.”
768,
768,“And were you pleased to see her struck?” I asked: having my designs in
768,encouraging his talk.
768,
768,"“I winked,” he answered: “I wink to see my father strike a dog or a"
768,"horse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first—she deserved"
768,"punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to"
768,"the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her"
768,"teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the"
768,"bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,"
768,and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can’t
768,speak for pain. I don’t like to think so; but she’s a naughty thing for
768,"crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I’m afraid of her.”"
768,
768,“And you can get the key if you choose?” I said.
768,
768,"“Yes, when I am upstairs,” he answered; “but I can’t walk upstairs"
768,now.”
768,
768,“In what apartment is it?” I asked.
768,
768,"“Oh,” he cried, “I shan’t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret."
768,"Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you’ve tired"
768,"me—go away, go away!” And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut"
768,his eyes again.
768,
768,"I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring"
768,"a rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the"
768,"astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was"
768,"intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two"
768,or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar’s door:
768,"but I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him,"
768,even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation
768,awaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was
768,"thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He"
768,"thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and"
768,spoke.
768,
768,"“Catherine is coming, dear master!” I whispered; “she is alive and"
768,"well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.”"
768,
768,"I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,"
768,"looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As"
768,"soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at"
768,the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite
768,true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I
768,describe all his father’s brutal conduct—my intentions being to add no
768,"bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup."
768,
768,He divined that one of his enemy’s purposes was to secure the personal
768,"property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why"
768,"he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because"
768,ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.
768,"However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of"
768,"leaving Catherine’s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put"
768,"it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her"
768,"children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall"
768,to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.
768,
768,"Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,"
768,"and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young"
768,lady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single
768,"servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he"
768,"arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;"
768,and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village
768,that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before
768,morning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word
768,that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would
768,not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for
768,"listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving"
768,"to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it"
768,"literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her"
768,"father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be"
768,killed on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!
768,
768,"Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone"
768,downstairs at three o’clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing
768,"through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front"
768,"door made me jump. “Oh! it is Green,” I said, recollecting myself—“only"
768,"Green,” and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but"
768,"the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the"
768,jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon
768,shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little
768,"mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, “Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?”"
768,
768,"“Yes,” I cried: “yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe"
768,with us again!”
768,
768,"She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton’s"
768,"room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,"
768,"and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron."
768,"Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to"
768,"say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon"
768,"comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured"
768,me she would not complain.
768,
768,I couldn’t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the
768,"chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,"
768,"then. All was composed, however: Catherine’s despair was as silent as"
768,"her father’s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed"
768,on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.
768,
768,"He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he"
768,"murmured,—“I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to"
768,"us!” and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant"
768,"gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None"
768,"could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely"
768,without a struggle.
768,
768,"Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too"
768,"weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she"
768,"sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that"
768,"deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It"
768,"was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the"
768,"lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how"
768,to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of
768,"his delay in obeying my master’s summons. Fortunately, no thought of"
768,"worldly affairs crossed the latter’s mind, to disturb him, after his"
768,daughter’s arrival.
768,
768,Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the
768,"place. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have"
768,carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar
768,"Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with"
768,"his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud"
768,protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral
768,"was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered"
768,to stay at the Grange till her father’s corpse had quitted it.
768,
768,She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the
768,"risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,"
768,and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff’s answer. It drove her
768,desperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon
768,"after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father"
768,"re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without"
768,"shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep"
768,"with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole"
768,out before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs
768,should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined
768,"their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother’s, she got easily"
768,"out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree"
768,"close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,"
768,notwithstanding his timid contrivances.
768,

768,CHAPTER XXIX
768,
768,
768,"The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the"
768,"library; now musing mournfully—one of us despairingly—on our loss, now"
768,venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.
768,
768,We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would
768,be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during
768,"Linton’s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as"
768,housekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be
768,"hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect"
768,"of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved"
768,"young mistress; when a servant—one of the discarded ones, not yet"
768,"departed—rushed hastily in, and said “that devil Heathcliff” was coming"
768,through the court: should he fasten the door in his face?
768,
768,"If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He"
768,"made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and"
768,"availed himself of the master’s privilege to walk straight in, without"
768,saying a word. The sound of our informant’s voice directed him to the
768,"library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door."
768,
768,"It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,"
768,eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the
768,"same autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but"
768,"all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the"
768,"splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband."
768,Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person
768,either. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more
768,"composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other"
768,"difference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she"
768,saw him.
768,
768,"“Stop!” he said, arresting her by the arm. “No more runnings away!"
768,Where would you go? I’m come to fetch you home; and I hope you’ll be a
768,dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I
768,was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the
768,"business: he’s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you’ll"
768,see by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one
768,"evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and"
768,"never touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room"
768,"to ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and"
768,since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I
768,"fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and"
768,"shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him"
768,"from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must"
768,come: he’s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.”
768,
768,"“Why not let Catherine continue here,” I pleaded, “and send Master"
768,"Linton to her? As you hate them both, you’d not miss them: they _can_"
768,only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.”
768,
768,"“I’m seeking a tenant for the Grange,” he answered; “and I want my"
768,"children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services"
768,for her bread. I’m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness
768,"after Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don’t oblige"
768,me to compel you.”
768,
768,"“I shall,” said Catherine. “Linton is all I have to love in the world,"
768,"and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and"
768,"me to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt"
768,"him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!”"
768,
768,"“You are a boastful champion,” replied Heathcliff; “but I don’t like"
768,you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the
768,"torment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to"
768,you—it is his own sweet spirit. He’s as bitter as gall at your
768,desertion and its consequences: don’t expect thanks for this noble
768,devotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he
768,"would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his"
768,very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.”
768,
768,"“I know he has a bad nature,” said Catherine: “he’s your son. But I’m"
768,"glad I’ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that"
768,"reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;"
768,"and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of"
768,thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_
768,"miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?"
768,_Nobody_ loves you—_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn’t
768,be you!”
768,
768,Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made
768,"up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw"
768,pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.
768,
768,"“You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,” said her father-in-law,"
768,"“if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your"
768,things!”
768,
768,She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah’s
768,"place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would"
768,"suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first"
768,"time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the"
768,"pictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton’s, he said—“I shall have that"
768,"home. Not because I need it, but—” He turned abruptly to the fire, and"
768,"continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a"
768,"smile—“I’ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was"
768,"digging Linton’s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I"
768,"opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her"
768,face again—it is hers yet!—he had hard work to stir me; but he said it
768,"would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the"
768,"coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton’s side, damn him! I wish"
768,he’d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away
768,"when I’m laid there, and slide mine out too; I’ll have it made so: and"
768,then by the time Linton gets to us he’ll not know which is which!”
768,
768,"“You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!” I exclaimed; “were you not"
768,ashamed to disturb the dead?”
768,
768,"“I disturbed nobody, Nelly,” he replied; “and I gave some ease to"
768,myself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you’ll have a
768,"better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed"
768,"her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen"
768,years—incessantly—remorselessly—till yesternight; and yesternight I was
768,"tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with"
768,my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.”
768,
768,"“And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you"
768,have dreamt of then?” I said.
768,
768,"“Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!” he answered. “Do"
768,you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a
768,"transformation on raising the lid, but I’m better pleased that it should"
768,"not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct"
768,"impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would"
768,hardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she
768,"died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her"
768,spirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they
768,"can, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall"
768,of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as
768,winter—all round was solitary. I didn’t fear that her fool of a husband
768,would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring
768,"them there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the"
768,"sole barrier between us, I said to myself—‘I’ll have her in my arms"
768,"again! If she be cold, I’ll think it is this north wind that chills"
768,"_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.’ I got a spade from the"
768,"tool-house, and began to delve with all my might—it scraped the coffin;"
768,I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the
768,"screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that"
768,"I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and"
768,"bending down. ‘If I can only get this off,’ I muttered, ‘I wish they"
768,may shovel in the earth over us both!’ and I wrenched at it more
768,"desperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared"
768,to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew
768,"no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you"
768,"perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it"
768,"cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not"
768,"under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my"
768,"heart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned"
768,consoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it
768,"remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh,"
768,if you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was
768,"with me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the"
768,"Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I"
768,"remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I"
768,"remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying"
768,"upstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently—I felt her by"
768,"me—I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have"
768,"sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning—from the fervour of"
768,my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed
768,"herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then,"
768,"sometimes more and sometimes less, I’ve been the sport of that"
768,intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch
768,"that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have"
768,relaxed to the feebleness of Linton’s. When I sat in the house with
768,"Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked"
768,on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I
768,"hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was"
768,certain! And when I slept in her chamber—I was beaten out of that. I
768,"couldn’t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either"
768,"outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,"
768,or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a
768,child; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them
768,a hundred times a night—to be always disappointed! It racked me! I’ve
768,"often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that"
768,"my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I’ve seen"
768,"her, I’m pacified—a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by"
768,"inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the"
768,spectre of a hope through eighteen years!”
768,
768,"Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet"
768,"with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,"
768,"the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the"
768,"grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of"
768,"trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one"
768,"absorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence."
768,I didn’t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his
768,"meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa"
768,to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine
768,"entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be"
768,saddled.
768,
768,"“Send that over to-morrow,” said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,"
768,"he added: “You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and"
768,"you’ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,"
768,your own feet will serve you. Come along.”
768,
768,"“Good-bye, Ellen!” whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me,"
768,"her lips felt like ice. “Come and see me, Ellen; don’t forget.”"
768,
768,"“Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!” said her new father. “When"
768,I wish to speak to you I’ll come here. I want none of your prying at my
768,house!”
768,
768,He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my
768,"heart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the"
768,garden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine’s arm under his: though she disputed
768,the act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into
768,"the alley, whose trees concealed them."
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXX
768,
768,
768,"I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she"
768,"left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,"
768,"and wouldn’t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was “thrang,” and the"
768,"master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,"
768,otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks
768,"Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My"
768,young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.
768,"Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his"
768,"daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,"
768,"being a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child’s"
768,"annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted"
768,"my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some"
768,"great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a"
768,"little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and"
768,this is what she told me.
768,
768,"“The first thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said, “on her arrival at the"
768,"Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me"
768,"and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton’s room, and remained till"
768,"morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she"
768,"entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be"
768,sent for? her cousin was very ill.
768,
768,“‘We know that!’ answered Heathcliff; ‘but his life is not worth a
768,"farthing, and I won’t spend a farthing on him.’"
768,
768,"“‘But I cannot tell how to do,’ she said; ‘and if nobody will help me,"
768,he’ll die!’
768,
768,"“‘Walk out of the room,’ cried the master, ‘and let me never hear a"
768,"word more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act"
768,"the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.’"
768,
768,"“Then she began to bother me, and I said I’d had enough plague with the"
768,"tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:"
768,Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.
768,
768,"“How they managed together, I can’t tell. I fancy he fretted a great"
768,"deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little"
768,rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes
768,"came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would"
768,fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never
768,"dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that"
768,"Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to"
768,"advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice,"
768,"after we had gone to bed, I’ve happened to open my door again and seen"
768,her sitting crying on the stairs’-top; and then I’ve shut myself in
768,"quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I’m"
768,"sure: still I didn’t wish to lose my place, you know."
768,
768,"“At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me"
768,"out of my wits, by saying, ‘Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is"
768,"dying—I’m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.’"
768,
768,"“Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an"
768,hour listening and trembling. Nothing stirred—the house was quiet.
768,
768,"“She’s mistaken, I said to myself. He’s got over it. I needn’t disturb"
768,them; and I began to doze. But my sleep was marred a second time by a
768,"sharp ringing of the bell—the only bell we have, put up on purpose for"
768,"Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and"
768,inform them that he wouldn’t have that noise repeated.
768,
768,"“I delivered Catherine’s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few"
768,"minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I"
768,"followed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands"
768,"folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to"
768,"Linton’s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to"
768,her.
768,
768,"“‘Now—Catherine,’ he said, ‘how do you feel?’"
768,
768,“She was dumb.
768,
768,"“‘How do you feel, Catherine?’ he repeated."
768,
768,"“‘He’s safe, and I’m free,’ she answered: ‘I should feel well—but,’ she"
768,"continued, with a bitterness she couldn’t conceal, ‘you have left me so"
768,"long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death! I"
768,feel like death!’
768,
768,"“And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little wine. Hareton and"
768,"Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and"
768,"heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe,"
768,of the lad’s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was
768,more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But
768,the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn’t want his help. He
768,"afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to"
768,"return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself."
768,
768,"“In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to"
768,"breakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she"
768,"was ill; at which I hardly wondered. I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he"
768,"replied,—‘Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and"
768,"then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell"
768,me.’”
768,
768,"Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her"
768,"twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts"
768,at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.
768,
768,"Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton’s will. He had bequeathed"
768,"the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his"
768,"father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act"
768,"during her week’s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a"
768,"minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed"
768,and kept them in his wife’s right and his also: I suppose legally; at
768,"any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his"
768,possession.
768,
768,"“Nobody,” said Zillah, “ever approached her door, except that once, but"
768,I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her
768,coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried
768,"out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn’t bear any longer"
768,being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross
768,"Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn’t hinder her from descending; so, as"
768,"soon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance,"
768,"donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as"
768,plain as a Quaker: she couldn’t comb them out.
768,
768,"“Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:” the kirk, (you know,"
768,"has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists’"
768,"or Baptists’ place, I can’t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)"
768,"“Joseph had gone,” she continued, “but I thought proper to bide at"
768,home. Young folks are always the better for an elder’s over-looking;
768,"and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn’t a model of nice behaviour."
768,"I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she"
768,had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good
768,"leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He"
768,"coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes."
768,The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw
768,"he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted"
768,"to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master"
768,"is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion."
768,"He grew sullen, and began to swear."
768,
768,"“Now, Mrs. Dean,” Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,"
768,“you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen
768,you’re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg
768,"lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,"
768,"now? She’s as poor as you or I: poorer, I’ll be bound: you’re saving,"
768,and I’m doing my little all that road.”
768,
768,Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into
768,"a good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former"
768,"insults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper’s"
768,account.
768,
768,"“Missis walked in,” she said, “as chill as an icicle, and as high as a"
768,"princess. I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair. No, she"
768,"turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come"
768,"to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved."
768,
768,"“‘I’ve been starved a month and more,’ she answered, resting on the"
768,word as scornful as she could.
768,
768,"“And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both"
768,"of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and"
768,discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her
768,"feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her"
768,"cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage"
768,"to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that"
768,came to hand.
768,
768,"“That was a great advance for the lad. She didn’t thank him; still, he"
768,"felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to"
768,"stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what"
768,struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was
768,he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his
768,finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking
768,"at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for"
768,"something to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in"
768,"the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn’t see, and she"
768,"couldn’t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but"
768,"attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring"
768,"to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if"
768,"it were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started"
768,round in such a taking.
768,
768,“‘Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping
768,"there?’ she cried, in a tone of disgust. ‘I can’t endure you! I’ll go"
768,"upstairs again, if you come near me.’"
768,
768,"“Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down"
768,"in the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes"
768,"another half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me."
768,
768,"“‘Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah? I’m stalled of doing naught;"
768,"and I do like—I could like to hear her! Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask"
768,of yourseln.’
768,
768,"“‘Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma’am,’ I said, immediately."
768,‘He’d take it very kind—he’d be much obliged.’
768,
768,"“She frowned; and looking up, answered—"
768,
768,"“‘Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to"
768,understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the
768,"hypocrisy to offer! I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any"
768,"of you! When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see"
768,"one of your faces, you all kept off. But I won’t complain to you! I’m"
768,driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your
768,society.’
768,
768,“‘What could I ha’ done?’ began Earnshaw. ‘How was I to blame?’
768,
768,"“‘Oh! you are an exception,’ answered Mrs. Heathcliff. ‘I never missed"
768,such a concern as you.’
768,
768,"“‘But I offered more than once, and asked,’ he said, kindling up at her"
768,"pertness, ‘I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you—’"
768,
768,"“‘Be silent! I’ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your"
768,disagreeable voice in my ear!’ said my lady.
768,
768,"“Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his"
768,"gun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer. He"
768,"talked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her"
768,"solitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was"
768,"forced to condescend to our company, more and more. However, I took"
768,"care there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since,"
768,I’ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us:
768,"and she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her,"
768,and she’ll curl back without respect of any one. She’ll snap at the
768,"master himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more"
768,"hurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.”"
768,
768,"At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my"
768,"situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:"
768,but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton
768,"in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless"
768,she could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my
768,province to arrange.
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"Thus ended Mrs. Dean’s story. Notwithstanding the doctor’s prophecy, I"
768,am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week
768,"in January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and"
768,"riding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall"
768,"spend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out"
768,for another tenant to take the place after October. I would not pass
768,another winter here for much.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXXI
768,
768,
768,"Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I went to the Heights as I"
768,proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to
768,"her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not"
768,"conscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open,"
768,"but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and"
768,"invoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I"
768,entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took
768,particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best
768,apparently to make the least of his advantages.
768,
768,"I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home? He answered, No; but he would"
768,"be in at dinner-time. It was eleven o’clock, and I announced my"
768,intention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately
768,"flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not"
768,as a substitute for the host.
768,
768,"We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in"
768,preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more
768,sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly
768,"raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the"
768,same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning
768,my bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.
768,
768,"“She does not seem so amiable,” I thought, “as Mrs. Dean would persuade"
768,"me to believe. She’s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.”"
768,
768,Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. “Remove them
768,"yourself,” she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and"
768,"retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of"
768,birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached
768,"her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied,"
768,"adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean’s note on to her knee, unnoticed by"
768,"Hareton—but she asked aloud, “What is that?” And chucked it off."
768,
768,"“A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,” I"
768,"answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it"
768,should be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered
768,"it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it"
768,"in his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first."
768,"Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very"
768,"stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her"
768,"eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer"
768,"feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her,"
768,as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;
768,"then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and"
768,"irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured"
768,in soliloquy:
768,
768,“I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be
768,"climbing up there! Oh! I’m tired—I’m _stalled_, Hareton!” And she leant"
768,"her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a"
768,"sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring"
768,nor knowing whether we remarked her.
768,
768,"“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said, after sitting some time mute, “you are not"
768,aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it
768,strange you won’t come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of
768,talking about and praising you; and she’ll be greatly disappointed if I
768,"return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter"
768,and said nothing!”
768,
768,"She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,—"
768,
768,“Does Ellen like you?”
768,
768,"“Yes, very well,” I replied, hesitatingly."
768,
768,"“You must tell her,” she continued, “that I would answer her letter,"
768,but I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might
768,tear a leaf.”
768,
768,“No books!” I exclaimed. “How do you contrive to live here without
768,them? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a
768,"large library, I’m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books"
768,"away, and I should be desperate!”"
768,
768,"“I was always reading, when I had them,” said Catherine; “and Mr."
768,Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my
768,"books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched"
768,"through Joseph’s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once,"
768,"Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room—some Latin and Greek,"
768,and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here—and
768,"you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love"
768,of stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in
768,"the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall."
768,Perhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my
768,treasures? But I’ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my
768,"heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!”"
768,
768,Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his
768,"private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of"
768,her accusations.
768,
768,"“Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,” I"
768,"said, coming to his rescue. “He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your"
768,attainments. He’ll be a clever scholar in a few years.”
768,
768,"“And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,” answered Catherine."
768,"“Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty"
768,blunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did
768,yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning
768,"over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing"
768,because you couldn’t read their explanations!”
768,
768,The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at
768,"for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a"
768,"similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean’s anecdote of his first"
768,"attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I"
768,"observed,—“But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and"
768,each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned
768,"instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.”"
768,
768,"“Oh!” she replied, “I don’t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he"
768,"has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me"
768,"with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose"
768,"and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to"
768,"have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has"
768,"selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out"
768,of deliberate malice.”
768,
768,Hareton’s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe
768,"sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to"
768,"suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his"
768,"embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the"
768,"external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the"
768,"room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his"
768,"hands, which he threw into Catherine’s lap, exclaiming,—“Take them! I"
768,"never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!”"
768,
768,"“I won’t have them now,” she answered. “I shall connect them with you,"
768,and hate them.”
768,
768,"She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a"
768,"portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it"
768,"from her. “And listen,” she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse"
768,of an old ballad in the same fashion.
768,
768,"But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not"
768,"altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue."
768,The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin’s sensitive
768,"though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode"
768,"he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the"
768,inflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the
768,fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that
768,"sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the"
768,"pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing"
768,pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the
768,incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily
768,"labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path."
768,"Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters"
768,to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning
768,"him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the"
768,contrary result.
768,
768,"“Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!”"
768,"cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the"
768,conflagration with indignant eyes.
768,
768,"“You’d _better_ hold your tongue, now,” he answered fiercely."
768,
768,And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the
768,"entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the"
768,"door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,"
768,"and laying hold of his shoulder asked,—“What’s to do now, my lad?”"
768,
768,"“Naught, naught,” he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger"
768,in solitude.
768,
768,"Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed."
768,
768,"“It will be odd if I thwart myself,” he muttered, unconscious that I"
768,"was behind him. “But when I look for his father in his face, I find"
768,_her_ every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to
768,see him.”
768,
768,"He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a"
768,"restless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked"
768,"there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on"
768,"perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,"
768,so that I remained alone.
768,
768,"“I’m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, in"
768,reply to my greeting; “from selfish motives partly: I don’t think I
768,could readily supply your loss in this desolation. I’ve wondered more
768,than once what brought you here.”
768,
768,"“An idle whim, I fear, sir,” was my answer; “or else an idle whim is"
768,going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I
768,must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross
768,Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall
768,not live there any more.”
768,
768,"“Oh, indeed; you’re tired of being banished from the world, are you?”"
768,he said. “But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you
768,"won’t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my"
768,due from any one.”
768,
768,"“I’m coming to plead off nothing about it,” I exclaimed, considerably"
768,"irritated. “Should you wish it, I’ll settle with you now,” and I drew"
768,my note-book from my pocket.
768,
768,"“No, no,” he replied, coolly; “you’ll leave sufficient behind to cover"
768,"your debts, if you fail to return: I’m not in such a hurry. Sit down"
768,and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his
768,visit can generally be made welcome. Catherine! bring the things in:
768,where are you?”
768,
768,"Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks."
768,
768,"“You may get your dinner with Joseph,” muttered Heathcliff, aside, “and"
768,remain in the kitchen till he is gone.”
768,
768,She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no
768,"temptation to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she"
768,probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets
768,them.
768,
768,"With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,"
768,"absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and"
768,"bade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last"
768,glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders
768,"to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I"
768,could not fulfil my wish.
768,
768,"“How dreary life gets over in that house!” I reflected, while riding"
768,down the road. “What a realisation of something more romantic than a
768,"fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I"
768,"struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated"
768,together into the stirring atmosphere of the town!”
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXXII
768,
768,
768,1802.—This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend
768,"in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came"
768,within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside
768,"public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a"
768,"cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he"
768,"remarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after"
768,other folk wi’ ther harvest.”
768,
768,“Gimmerton?” I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown
768,dim and dreamy. “Ah! I know. How far is it from this?”
768,
768,"“Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,” he answered."
768,
768,A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely
768,"noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own"
768,"roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange"
768,"matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading"
768,"the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to"
768,"inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,"
768,we managed the distance in some three hours.
768,
768,"I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church"
768,"looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a"
768,"moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm"
768,weather—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from
768,enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer
768,"August, I’m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its"
768,"solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more"
768,"divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells"
768,of heath.
768,
768,"I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the"
768,"family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,"
768,"blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I"
768,"rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat"
768,"knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a"
768,meditative pipe.
768,
768,“Is Mrs. Dean within?” I demanded of the dame.
768,
768,"“Mistress Dean? Nay!” she answered, “she doesn’t bide here: shoo’s up"
768,at th’ Heights.”
768,
768,"“Are you the housekeeper, then?” I continued."
768,
768,"“Eea, Aw keep th’ hause,” she replied."
768,
768,"“Well, I’m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me"
768,"in, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.”"
768,
768,"“T’ maister!” she cried in astonishment. “Whet, whoiver knew yah wur"
768,coming? Yah sud ha’ send word. They’s nowt norther dry nor mensful
768,abaht t’ place: nowt there isn’t!”
768,
768,"She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I"
768,"entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,"
768,"that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her"
768,"be composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to"
768,"prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to"
768,"sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were"
768,necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the
768,"hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and"
768,"malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,"
768,confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.
768,Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An
768,"after-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court."
768,
768,“All well at the Heights?” I inquired of the woman.
768,
768,"“Eea, f’r owt ee knaw!” she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot"
768,cinders.
768,
768,"I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was"
768,"impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my"
768,"exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,"
768,"and the mild glory of a rising moon in front—one fading, and the other"
768,"brightening—as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road"
768,branching off to Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight
768,"of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the"
768,"west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of"
768,"grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to"
768,"knock—it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I"
768,"noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and"
768,wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.
768,
768,"Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a"
768,"coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which"
768,the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house
768,of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space
768,for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates
768,there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I
768,"could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and"
768,listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of
768,"curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered."
768,
768,“Con-_trary_!” said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. “That for the
768,"third time, you dunce! I’m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or"
768,I’ll pull your hair!”
768,
768,"“Contrary, then,” answered another, in deep but softened tones. “And"
768,"now, kiss me, for minding so well.”"
768,
768,"“No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.”"
768,
768,"The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed"
768,"and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features"
768,"glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the"
768,"page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a"
768,"smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of"
768,"inattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets"
768,"blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to"
768,superintend his studies; and her face—it was lucky he could not see her
768,"face, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip"
768,"in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing"
768,something besides staring at its smiting beauty.
768,
768,"The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil"
768,"claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he"
768,"generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their"
768,conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on
768,the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw’s
768,"heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions"
768,if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and
768,"feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the"
768,kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at
768,"the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which"
768,was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and
768,"intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents."
768,
768,"“I’d rayther, by th’ haulf, hev’ ’em swearing i’ my lugs fro’h morn to"
768,"neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!” said the tenant of the kitchen, in"
768,"answer to an unheard speech of Nelly’s. “It’s a blazing shame, that I"
768,"cannot oppen t’ blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan,"
768,and all t’ flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th’ warld!
768,Oh! ye’re a raight nowt; and shoo’s another; and that poor lad ’ll be
768,"lost atween ye. Poor lad!” he added, with a groan; “he’s witched: I’m"
768,"sartin on’t. Oh, Lord, judge ’em, for there’s norther law nor justice"
768,among wer rullers!”
768,
768,"“No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,” retorted"
768,"the singer. “But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian,"
768,and never mind me. This is ‘Fairy Annie’s Wedding’—a bonny tune—it goes
768,to a dance.”
768,
768,"Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me"
768,"directly, she jumped to her feet, crying—“Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!"
768,How could you think of returning in this way? All’s shut up at
768,Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!”
768,
768,"“I’ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,”"
768,I answered. “I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted
768,"here, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.”"
768,
768,"“Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went"
768,"to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you"
768,walked from Gimmerton this evening?”
768,
768,"“From the Grange,” I replied; “and while they make me lodging room"
768,"there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don’t"
768,think of having another opportunity in a hurry.”
768,
768,"“What business, sir?” said Nelly, conducting me into the house. “He’s"
768,"gone out at present, and won’t return soon.”"
768,
768,"“About the rent,” I answered."
768,
768,"“Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,” she observed;"
768,"“or rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I"
768,act for her: there’s nobody else.”
768,
768,I looked surprised.
768,
768,"“Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff’s death, I see,” she continued."
768,
768,"“Heathcliff dead!” I exclaimed, astonished. “How long ago?”"
768,
768,"“Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I’ll"
768,"tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?”"
768,
768,“I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I
768,never dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you
768,don’t expect them back for some time—the young people?”
768,
768,“No—I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they
768,"don’t care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do"
768,you good: you seem weary.”
768,
768,"She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph"
768,asking whether “it warn’t a crying scandal that she should have
768,"followers at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o’ t’"
768,maister’s cellar! He fair shaamed to ’bide still and see it.”
768,
768,"She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a"
768,"reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness."
768,And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff’s
768,"history. He had a “queer” end, as she expressed it."
768,
768,* * * * *
768,
768,
768,"I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving"
768,"us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine’s sake. My first"
768,interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much
768,since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for
768,"taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,"
768,and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my
768,"sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to"
768,see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement;
768,"and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other"
768,"articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered"
768,myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last
768,"long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable"
768,"and restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the"
768,"garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as"
768,"spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to"
768,"quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred"
768,quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her
768,solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often
768,"obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the"
768,house to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his
768,"approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or"
768,addressing him—and though he was always as sullen and silent as
768,"possible—after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable"
768,of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and
768,idleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he
768,"lived—how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and"
768,dozing.
768,
768,"“He’s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?” she once observed, “or a"
768,"cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What"
768,"a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if"
768,"you do, what is it about? But you can’t speak to me!”"
768,
768,Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look
768,again.
768,
768,"“He’s, perhaps, dreaming now,” she continued. “He twitched his shoulder"
768,"as Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.”"
768,
768,"“Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don’t"
768,behave!” I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his
768,"fist, as if tempted to use it."
768,
768,"“I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,” she"
768,"exclaimed, on another occasion. “He is afraid I shall laugh at him."
768,"Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and,"
768,"because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a"
768,fool?”
768,
768,“Were not you naughty?” I said; “answer me that.”
768,
768,"“Perhaps I was,” she went on; “but I did not expect him to be so silly."
768,"Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I’ll try!”"
768,
768,"She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and"
768,"muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck."
768,
768,"“Well, I shall put it here,” she said, “in the table-drawer; and I’m"
768,going to bed.”
768,
768,"Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But"
768,"he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her"
768,great disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness
768,and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off
768,improving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was
768,"at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such"
768,"stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would"
768,bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was
768,"there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book"
768,lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a
768,"mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to"
768,"smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of"
768,"the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense,"
768,"as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to"
768,disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting
768,"expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to"
768,"her, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a"
768,"last resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was"
768,useless.
768,
768,"Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had"
768,almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at
768,"the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the"
768,kitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter
768,"cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach"
768,"home. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the"
768,"fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. It suited"
768,"Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room"
768,upstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business
768,"below, that she might accompany me."
768,
768,"On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and,"
768,"in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw"
768,"sat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was"
768,"beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes,"
768,"varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered"
768,"ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the"
768,"direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the"
768,grate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my
768,"light, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on"
768,"her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin—“I’ve found out,"
768,"Hareton, that I want—that I’m glad—that I should like you to be my"
768,"cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.”"
768,
768,Hareton returned no answer.
768,
768,"“Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?” she continued."
768,
768,"“Get off wi’ ye!” he growled, with uncompromising gruffness."
768,
768,"“Let me take that pipe,” she said, cautiously advancing her hand and"
768,abstracting it from his mouth.
768,
768,"Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the"
768,fire. He swore at her and seized another.
768,
768,"“Stop,” she cried, “you must listen to me first; and I can’t speak"
768,while those clouds are floating in my face.”
768,
768,"“Will you go to the devil!” he exclaimed, ferociously, “and let me be!”"
768,
768,"“No,” she persisted, “I won’t: I can’t tell what to do to make you talk"
768,to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you
768,"stupid, I don’t mean anything: I don’t mean that I despise you. Come,"
768,"you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall"
768,own me.”
768,
768,"“I shall have naught to do wi’ you and your mucky pride, and your"
768,"damned mocking tricks!” he answered. “I’ll go to hell, body and soul,"
768,"before I look sideways after you again. Side out o’ t’ gate, now, this"
768,minute!”
768,
768,"Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip,"
768,"and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing"
768,tendency to sob.
768,
768,"“You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,” I interrupted,"
768,“since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of
768,good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.”
768,
768,"“A companion!” he cried; “when she hates me, and does not think me fit"
768,"to wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I’d not be scorned for"
768,seeking her good-will any more.”
768,
768,"“It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!” wept Cathy, no"
768,longer disguising her trouble. “You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff
768,"does, and more.”"
768,
768,"“You’re a damned liar,” began Earnshaw: “why have I made him angry, by"
768,"taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at"
768,"and despised me, and—Go on plaguing me, and I’ll step in yonder, and"
768,say you worried me out of the kitchen!”
768,
768,"“I didn’t know you took my part,” she answered, drying her eyes; “and I"
768,"was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you"
768,to forgive me: what can I do besides?”
768,
768,"She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened"
768,"and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely"
768,"clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct,"
768,"must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that"
768,"prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant"
768,"undecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The"
768,"little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took"
768,"her former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head"
768,"reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered—“Well! what should I"
768,"have done, Ellen? He wouldn’t shake hands, and he wouldn’t look: I must"
768,show him some way that I like him—that I want to be friends.”
768,
768,"Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,"
768,"for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did"
768,"raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes."
768,
768,Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white
768,"paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to"
768,"“Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,” she desired me to be her ambassadress, and"
768,convey the present to its destined recipient.
768,
768,"“And tell him, if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him to read it"
768,"right,” she said; “and, if he refuse it, I’ll go upstairs, and never"
768,tease him again.”
768,
768,"I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my"
768,"employer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee."
768,"He did not strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine"
768,"leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle"
768,"of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated"
768,"herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his"
768,rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not
768,"summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her"
768,"questioning look, and her murmured petition."
768,
768,"“Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking"
768,that little word.”
768,
768,He muttered something inaudible.
768,
768,"“And you’ll be my friend?” added Catherine, interrogatively."
768,
768,"“Nay, you’ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,” he answered;"
768,"“and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.”"
768,
768,"“So you won’t be my friend?” she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and"
768,creeping close up.
768,
768,"I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round"
768,"again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of"
768,"the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on"
768,"both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies."
768,
768,The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their
768,position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.
768,"He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated"
768,"on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his"
768,shoulder; and confounded at his favourite’s endurance of her proximity:
768,it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that
768,"night. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as"
768,"he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with"
768,"dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day’s"
768,transactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.
768,
768,"“Tak’ these in to t’ maister, lad,” he said, “and bide there. I’s gang"
768,up to my own rahm. This hoile’s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we
768,mun side out and seearch another.”
768,
768,"“Come, Catherine,” I said, “we must ‘side out’ too: I’ve done my"
768,ironing. Are you ready to go?”
768,
768,"“It is not eight o’clock!” she answered, rising unwillingly. “Hareton,"
768,"I’ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I’ll bring some more"
768,to-morrow.”
768,
768,"“Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak’ into th’ hahse,” said Joseph,"
768,"“and it’ll be mitch if yah find ’em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!”"
768,
768,"Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as"
768,"she passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture"
768,"to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,"
768,during her earliest visits to Linton.
768,
768,The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered
768,"temporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish,"
768,"and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but"
768,both their minds tending to the same point—one loving and desiring to
768,"esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed—they contrived"
768,in the end to reach it.
768,
768,"You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff’s"
768,"heart. But now, I’m glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes"
768,will be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding
768,day: there won’t be a happier woman than myself in England!

768,CHAPTER XXXIII
768,
768,
768,"On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his"
768,"ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I"
768,"speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me,"
768,"as heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden,"
768,where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I
768,"went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to"
768,"clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and"
768,they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the
768,Grange.
768,
768,I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a
768,brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph’s
768,"eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of"
768,them.
768,
768,"“There! That will be all shown to the master,” I exclaimed, “the minute"
768,it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such
768,liberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head
768,"of it: see if we don’t! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more"
768,wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!”
768,
768,"“I’d forgotten they were Joseph’s,” answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;"
768,“but I’ll tell him I did it.”
768,
768,We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress’s post
768,in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine
768,"usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I"
768,presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than
768,she had in her hostility.
768,
768,"“Now, mind you don’t talk with and notice your cousin too much,” were"
768,my whispered instructions as we entered the room. “It will certainly
768,"annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he’ll be mad at you both.”"
768,
768,"“I’m not going to,” she answered."
768,
768,"The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in"
768,his plate of porridge.
768,
768,He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went
768,"on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh."
768,"I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was"
768,"occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance"
768,"evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with"
768,"deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at"
768,"last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his"
768,eye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with her accustomed
768,"look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred."
768,
768,"“It is well you are out of my reach,” he exclaimed. “What fiend"
768,"possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal"
768,eyes? Down with them! and don’t remind me of your existence again. I
768,thought I had cured you of laughing.”
768,
768,"“It was me,” muttered Hareton."
768,
768,“What do you say?” demanded the master.
768,
768,"Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr."
768,"Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast"
768,"and his interrupted musing. We had nearly finished, and the two young"
768,"people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further"
768,"disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,"
768,revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage
768,committed on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy
768,"and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws"
768,"worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech"
768,"difficult to understand, he began:—"
768,
768,"“I mun hev’ my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I’d"
768,"sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I’d lug my books up into t’ garret,"
768,"and all my bits o’ stuff, and they sud hev’ t’ kitchen to theirseln;"
768,"for t’ sake o’ quietness. It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but"
768,"I thowt I _could_ do that! But nah, shoo’s taan my garden fro’ me, and"
768,"by th’ heart, maister, I cannot stand it! Yah may bend to th’ yoak an"
768,"ye will—I noan used to ’t, and an old man doesn’t sooin get used to new"
768,barthens. I’d rayther arn my bite an’ my sup wi’ a hammer in th’ road!”
768,
768,"“Now, now, idiot!” interrupted Heathcliff, “cut it short! What’s your"
768,grievance? I’ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly. She may
768,thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.”
768,
768,“It’s noan Nelly!” answered Joseph. “I sudn’t shift for Nelly—nasty ill
768,nowt as shoo is. Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t’ sowl o’ nob’dy! Shoo
768,"wer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her ’bout winking."
768,"It’s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that’s witched our lad, wi’ her"
768,bold een and her forrard ways—till—Nay! it fair brusts my heart! He’s
768,"forgotten all I’ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up"
768,a whole row o’ t’ grandest currant-trees i’ t’ garden!” and here he
768,"lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and"
768,Earnshaw’s ingratitude and dangerous condition.
768,
768,"“Is the fool drunk?” asked Mr. Heathcliff. “Hareton, is it you he’s"
768,finding fault with?”
768,
768,"“I’ve pulled up two or three bushes,” replied the young man; “but I’m"
768,going to set ’em again.”
768,
768,“And why have you pulled them up?” said the master.
768,
768,Catherine wisely put in her tongue.
768,
768,"“We wanted to plant some flowers there,” she cried. “I’m the only"
768,"person to blame, for I wished him to do it.”"
768,
768,“And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?”
768,"demanded her father-in-law, much surprised. “And who ordered _you_ to"
768,"obey her?” he added, turning to Hareton."
768,
768,The latter was speechless; his cousin replied—“You shouldn’t grudge a
768,"few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my"
768,land!”
768,
768,"“Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,” said Heathcliff."
768,
768,"“And my money,” she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime"
768,"biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast."
768,
768,"“Silence!” he exclaimed. “Get done, and begone!”"
768,
768,"“And Hareton’s land, and his money,” pursued the reckless thing."
768,“Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!”
768,
768,"The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up,"
768,"eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate."
768,
768,"“If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,” she said; “so you may as"
768,well sit down.”
768,
768,"“If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I’ll strike him to"
768,"hell,” thundered Heathcliff. “Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse"
768,him against me? Off with her! Do you hear? Fling her into the kitchen!
768,"I’ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!”"
768,
768,"Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go."
768,
768,"“Drag her away!” he cried, savagely. “Are you staying to talk?” And he"
768,approached to execute his own command.
768,
768,"“He’ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,” said Catherine; “and he’ll"
768,soon detest you as much as I do.”
768,
768,"“Wisht! wisht!” muttered the young man, reproachfully; “I will not hear"
768,you speak so to him. Have done.”
768,
768,“But you won’t let him strike me?” she cried.
768,
768,"“Come, then,” he whispered earnestly."
768,
768,It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.
768,
768,"“Now, _you_ go!” he said to Earnshaw. “Accursed witch! this time she"
768,has provoked me when I could not bear it; and I’ll make her repent it
768,for ever!”
768,
768,"He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,"
768,entreating him not to hurt her that once. Heathcliff’s black eyes
768,"flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just"
768,"worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers"
768,"relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed"
768,"intently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a"
768,"moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,"
768,"said, with assumed calmness—“You must learn to avoid putting me in a"
768,"passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and"
768,keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton
768,"Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I’ll send him seeking his bread"
768,where he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.
768,"Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!”"
768,
768,I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the
768,"other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner."
768,"I had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he"
768,"perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of"
768,"us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that"
768,he should not return before evening.
768,
768,The two new friends established themselves in the house during his
768,"absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her"
768,offering a revelation of her father-in-law’s conduct to his father. He
768,said he wouldn’t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if
768,"he were the devil, it didn’t signify; he would stand by him; and he’d"
768,"rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr."
768,Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to
768,"make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak"
768,ill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the
768,master’s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger
768,"than reason could break—chains, forged by habit, which it would be"
768,"cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in"
768,avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning
768,Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to
768,"raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don’t believe she"
768,"has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter’s hearing, against her"
768,oppressor since.
768,
768,"When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as"
768,busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I
768,"came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so"
768,"soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got"
768,"on. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long"
768,"been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of"
768,"equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off"
768,rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been
768,bred; and Catherine’s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his
768,"industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added"
768,spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same
768,individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at
768,"Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired"
768,"and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He"
768,"came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a"
768,"full view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at"
768,"him. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless"
768,sight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red fire-light
768,"glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with"
768,"the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she"
768,"eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither"
768,experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.
768,
768,"They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps"
768,"you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they"
768,are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other
768,"likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of"
768,"the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or"
768,not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at
768,"all times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were"
768,"alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose"
768,this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in
768,evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young
768,"man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He"
768,"took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then"
768,returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her
768,"companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart"
768,"also, but he bid me sit still."
768,
768,"“It is a poor conclusion, is it not?” he observed, having brooded"
768,a while on the scene he had just witnessed: “an absurd termination to
768,my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two
768,"houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and"
768,"when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a"
768,slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me;
768,now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their
768,representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where is
768,the use? I don’t care for striking: I can’t take the trouble to raise
768,my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to
768,exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I
768,"have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle"
768,to destroy for nothing.
768,
768,"“Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I’m in its shadow at"
768,present. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly
768,remember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the
768,only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and
768,"that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her_ I won’t"
768,speak; and I don’t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were
768,invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He_ moves
768,"me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I’d"
768,never see him again! You’ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become
768,"so,” he added, making an effort to smile, “if I try to describe the"
768,thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.
768,But you’ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally
768,"secluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another."
768,
768,"“Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a"
768,"human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would"
768,have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first
768,"place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with"
768,"her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my"
768,"imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her"
768,"to me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor,"
768,"but her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every"
768,"tree—filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object"
768,by day—I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men
768,and women—my own features—mock me with a resemblance. The entire world
768,"is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I"
768,"have lost her! Well, Hareton’s aspect was the ghost of my immortal"
768,"love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride,"
768,"my happiness, and my anguish—"
768,
768,“But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you
768,"know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no"
768,benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it
768,partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on
768,together. I can give them no attention any more.”
768,
768,"“But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?” I said, alarmed"
768,"at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses,"
768,"nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy;"
768,"and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on"
768,"dark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a"
768,monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point
768,his wits were as sound as mine.
768,
768,"“I shall not know that till it comes,” he said; “I’m only half"
768,conscious of it now.”
768,
768,"“You have no feeling of illness, have you?” I asked."
768,
768,"“No, Nelly, I have not,” he answered."
768,
768,“Then you are not afraid of death?” I pursued.
768,
768,"“Afraid? No!” he replied. “I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,"
768,nor a hope of death. Why should I? With my hard constitution and
768,"temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and"
768,"probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black"
768,hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to
768,remind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is
768,like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the
768,slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I
768,"notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one"
768,"universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties"
768,"are yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so"
768,"unwaveringly, that I’m convinced it _will_ be reached—and"
768,_soon_—because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the
768,anticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me;
768,but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour
768,which I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!”
768,
768,"He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I"
768,"was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had"
768,turned his heart to an earthly hell. I wondered greatly how it would
768,"end. Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by"
768,"looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it"
768,"himself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have"
768,"conjectured the fact. You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and"
768,"at the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only"
768,"fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in"
768,company.
768,
768,
768,
768,
768,CHAPTER XXXIV
768,
768,
768,"For some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at"
768,meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.
768,"He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing"
768,rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed
768,sufficient sustenance for him.
768,
768,"One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and"
768,"out at the front door. I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning"
768,I found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet
768,"and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the"
768,two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After
768,"breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with"
768,my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled
768,"Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and"
768,"arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the"
768,influence of Joseph’s complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the
768,"spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my"
768,"young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose"
768,"roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr."
768,"Heathcliff was coming in. “And he spoke to me,” she added, with a"
768,perplexed countenance.
768,
768,“What did he say?” asked Hareton.
768,
768,"“He told me to begone as fast as I could,” she answered. “But he looked"
768,so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at
768,him.”
768,
768,“How?” he inquired.
768,
768,"“Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing—_very much_"
768,"excited, and wild, and glad!” she replied."
768,
768,"“Night-walking amuses him, then,” I remarked, affecting a careless"
768,"manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain"
768,the truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would
768,not be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff
768,"stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly,"
768,"he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of"
768,his whole face.
768,
768,"“Will you have some breakfast?” I said. “You must be hungry, rambling"
768,"about all night!” I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not"
768,like to ask directly.
768,
768,"“No, I’m not hungry,” he answered, averting his head, and speaking"
768,"rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the"
768,occasion of his good humour.
768,
768,I felt perplexed: I didn’t know whether it were not a proper
768,opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.
768,
768,"“I don’t think it right to wander out of doors,” I observed, “instead"
768,"of being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season. I"
768,"daresay you’ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the"
768,matter with you now!”
768,
768,"“Nothing but what I can bear,” he replied; “and with the greatest"
768,"pleasure, provided you’ll leave me alone: get in, and don’t annoy me.”"
768,
768,"I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat."
768,
768,"“Yes!” I reflected to myself, “we shall have a fit of illness. I cannot"
768,conceive what he has been doing.”
768,
768,"That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate"
768,"from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting."
768,
768,"“I’ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,” he remarked, in allusion to my"
768,morning’s speech; “and I’m ready to do justice to the food you give
768,me.”
768,
768,"He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the"
768,inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the
768,"table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We"
768,"saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal,"
768,and Earnshaw said he’d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we
768,had grieved him some way.
768,
768,"“Well, is he coming?” cried Catherine, when her cousin returned."
768,
768,"“Nay,” he answered; “but he’s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased"
768,indeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he
768,bid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of
768,anybody else.”
768,
768,I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he
768,"re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same"
768,unnatural—it was unnatural—appearance of joy under his black brows; the
768,"same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of"
768,"smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,"
768,"but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates—a strong thrilling, rather than"
768,trembling.
768,
768,"I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should? And I"
768,"exclaimed—“Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You look"
768,uncommonly animated.”
768,
768,“Where should good news come from to me?” he said. “I’m animated with
768,"hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.”"
768,
768,"“Your dinner is here,” I returned; “why won’t you get it?”"
768,
768,"“I don’t want it now,” he muttered, hastily: “I’ll wait till supper."
768,"And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other"
768,away from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this
768,place to myself.”
768,
768,“Is there some new reason for this banishment?” I inquired. “Tell me
768,"why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I’m"
768,"not putting the question through idle curiosity, but—”"
768,
768,"“You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,” he"
768,"interrupted, with a laugh. “Yet I’ll answer it. Last night I was on the"
768,"threshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my"
768,eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you’d better go!
768,"You’ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain"
768,from prying.”
768,
768,"Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed"
768,than ever.
768,
768,"He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on"
768,"his solitude; till, at eight o’clock, I deemed it proper, though"
768,"unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning"
768,"against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was"
768,turned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the
768,"room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so"
768,"still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was"
768,"distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or"
768,through the large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an
768,"ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced"
768,"shutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his."
768,
768,"“Must I close this?” I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not"
768,stir.
768,
768,"The light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I"
768,cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those
768,"deep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me,"
768,"not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle"
768,"bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness."
768,
768,"“Yes, close it,” he replied, in his familiar voice. “There, that is"
768,"pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick,"
768,and bring another.”
768,
768,"I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph—“The"
768,master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.” For I
768,dared not go in myself again just then.
768,
768,"Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it"
768,"back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining"
768,"that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till"
768,morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to
768,"his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its"
768,"window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get"
768,"through; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion,"
768,of which he had rather we had no suspicion.
768,
768,“Is he a ghoul or a vampire?” I mused. I had read of such hideous
768,incarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him
768,"in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost"
768,through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to
768,"that sense of horror. “But where did he come from, the little dark"
768,"thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?” muttered Superstition, as"
768,"I dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary"
768,"myself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my"
768,"waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim"
768,"variations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I"
768,"can remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of"
768,"dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton"
768,"about it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we"
768,"were obliged to content ourselves with the single word, “Heathcliff.”"
768,"That came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you’ll read, on his"
768,"headstone, only that, and the date of his death."
768,
768,"Dawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as"
768,"soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his"
768,"window. There were none. “He has stayed at home,” I thought, “and he’ll"
768,"be all right to-day.” I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my"
768,"usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the"
768,"master came down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of"
768,"doors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them."
768,
768,"On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were"
768,"conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute"
768,"directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and"
768,"turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression,"
768,even more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in
768,"the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him."
768,"He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at"
768,"the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up"
768,"and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest"
768,that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.
768,
768,"“Come now,” I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, “eat and"
768,"drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.”"
768,
768,"He didn’t notice me, and yet he smiled. I’d rather have seen him gnash"
768,his teeth than smile so.
768,
768,"“Mr. Heathcliff! master!” I cried, “don’t, for God’s sake, stare as if"
768,you saw an unearthly vision.”
768,
768,"“Don’t, for God’s sake, shout so loud,” he replied. “Turn round, and"
768,"tell me, are we by ourselves?”"
768,
768,"“Of course,” was my answer; “of course we are.”"
768,
768,"Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a"
768,sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the
768,"breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease."
768,
768,"Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded"
768,"him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two"
768,"yards’ distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both"
768,"pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet"
768,"raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The"
768,"fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with"
768,"unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned"
768,away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if
768,"he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he"
768,"stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched"
768,"before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their"
768,aim.
768,
768,"I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention"
768,"from its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up,"
768,asking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his
768,meals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn’t wait: I might set
768,"the things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house,"
768,"slowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the"
768,gate.
768,
768,The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to
768,"rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He returned after"
768,"midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room"
768,"beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and"
768,"descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a"
768,hundred idle misgivings.
768,
768,"I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring the floor,"
768,"and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a"
768,groan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was
768,"the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or"
768,suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and
768,"earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to"
768,walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his
768,"reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and"
768,began to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth sooner than I expected.
768,"He opened the door immediately, and said—“Nelly, come here—is it"
768,morning? Come in with your light.”
768,
768,"“It is striking four,” I answered. “You want a candle to take upstairs:"
768,you might have lit one at this fire.”
768,
768,"“No, I don’t wish to go upstairs,” he said. “Come in, and kindle _me_ a"
768,"fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.”"
768,
768,"“I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,” I replied,"
768,getting a chair and the bellows.
768,
768,"He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his"
768,heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for
768,common breathing between.
768,
768,"“When day breaks I’ll send for Green,” he said; “I wish to make some"
768,"legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters,"
768,and while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to
768,leave my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from
768,the face of the earth.”
768,
768,"“I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,” I interposed. “Let your will be"
768,a while: you’ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I
768,"never expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at"
768,"present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own"
768,fault. The way you’ve passed these three last days might knock up a
768,"Titan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at"
768,yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are
768,"hollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger"
768,and going blind with loss of sleep.”
768,
768,"“It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,” he replied. “I assure"
768,"you it is through no settled designs. I’ll do both, as soon as I"
768,possibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water
768,"rest within arms’ length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then"
768,"I’ll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my"
768,"injustices, I’ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I’m too"
768,"happy; and yet I’m not happy enough. My soul’s bliss kills my body, but"
768,does not satisfy itself.”
768,
768,"“Happy, master?” I cried. “Strange happiness! If you would hear me"
768,"without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you"
768,happier.”
768,
768,“What is that?” he asked. “Give it.”
768,
768,"“You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,” I said, “that from the time you were"
768,"thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and"
768,probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You
768,"must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have"
768,space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one—some
768,"minister of any denomination, it does not matter which—to explain it,"
768,and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how
768,"unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before"
768,you die?”
768,
768,"“I’m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,” he said, “for you remind me of"
768,the manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the
768,"churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please,"
768,"accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys"
768,my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor
768,need anything be said over me.—I tell you I have nearly attained _my_
768,heaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.”
768,
768,"“And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that"
768,"means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?” I"
768,"said, shocked at his godless indifference. “How would you like it?”"
768,
768,"“They won’t do that,” he replied: “if they did, you must have me"
768,"removed secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically,"
768,that the dead are not annihilated!”
768,
768,As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired
768,"to his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph"
768,"and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and,"
768,"with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody"
768,with him. I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and
768,"manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be"
768,his companion alone.
768,
768,"“I believe you think me a fiend,” he said, with his dismal laugh:"
768,“something too horrible to live under a decent roof.” Then turning to
768,"Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he"
768,"added, half sneeringly,—“Will _you_ come, chuck? I’ll not hurt you. No!"
768,"to you I’ve made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who"
768,"won’t shrink from my company! By God! she’s relentless. Oh, damn it!"
768,It’s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear—even mine.”
768,
768,He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his
768,"chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard"
768,him groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter;
768,"but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When"
768,"he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found"
768,"it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be"
768,left alone; so the doctor went away.
768,
768,"The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till"
768,"day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed"
768,"the master’s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He"
768,"cannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He"
768,"must either be up or out. But I’ll make no more ado, I’ll go boldly and"
768,look.
768,
768,"Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to"
768,"unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them"
768,"aside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there—laid on his back. His eyes"
768,"met mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile. I"
768,could not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with
768,"rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice,"
768,"flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no"
768,"blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I"
768,could doubt no more: he was dead and stark!
768,
768,I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I
768,"tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,"
768,life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would
768,not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and
768,"sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I"
768,"cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but"
768,resolutely refused to meddle with him.
768,
768,"“Th’ divil’s harried off his soul,” he cried, “and he may hev’ his"
768,"carcass into t’ bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked ’un he"
768,"looks, girning at death!” and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I"
768,thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly
768,"composing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and"
768,returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were
768,restored to their rights.
768,
768,I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred
768,"to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton,"
768,"the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by"
768,"the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand,"
768,"and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from"
768,contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs
768,"naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel."
768,
768,Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master
768,died. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four
768,"days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he"
768,did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange
768,"illness, not the cause."
768,
768,"We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished."
768,"Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin,"
768,comprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had
768,"let it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with"
768,"a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould"
768,himself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion
768,"mounds—and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks,"
768,"if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are"
768,"those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and"
768,"even within this house. Idle tales, you’ll say, and so say I. Yet that"
768,old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on ’em looking out
768,of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:—and an odd
768,thing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one
768,"evening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just at the turn of"
768,"the Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs"
768,before him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were
768,"skittish, and would not be guided."
768,
768,"“What is the matter, my little man?” I asked."
768,
768,"“There’s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t’ nab,” he blubbered,"
768,“un’ I darnut pass ’em.”
768,
768,"I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him"
768,take the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from
768,"thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard"
768,"his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don’t like being out"
768,in the dark now; and I don’t like being left by myself in this grim
768,"house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift"
768,to the Grange.
768,
768,"“They are going to the Grange, then?” I said."
768,
768,"“Yes,” answered Mrs. Dean, “as soon as they are married, and that will"
768,be on New Year’s Day.”
768,
768,“And who will live here then?”
768,
768,"“Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep"
768,"him company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut"
768,up.”
768,
768,“For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?” I observed.
768,
768,"“No, Mr. Lockwood,” said Nelly, shaking her head. “I believe the dead"
768,are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.”
768,
768,At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.
768,
768,"“_They_ are afraid of nothing,” I grumbled, watching their approach"
768,"through the window. “Together, they would brave Satan and all his"
768,legions.”
768,
768,"As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look"
768,"at the moon—or, more correctly, at each other by her light—I felt"
768,"irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance"
768,"into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my"
768,"rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;"
768,and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his
768,"fellow-servant’s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised"
768,me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his
768,feet.
768,
768,My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the
768,"kirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even"
768,in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and
768,"slates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof,"
768,to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.
768,
768,"I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next"
768,"the moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton’s"
768,only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff’s
768,still bare.
768,
768,"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths"
768,"fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind"
768,"breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever"
768,imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.
